      "text:  b\"it would be remarkable if the naive assumption that light linearly traces mass is correct .\\nindeed , on scales of tens of kiloparsecs around galaxies it is known from rotation curve information that dark matter is more dispersed than starlight .\\nit has long been entertained that dark matter might be more dispersed than light on megaparsec scales @xcite .\\nif so , we would say there is a ` bias ' between what we see and the physically more fundamental parameter , the mass .\\nsemi - analytic models @xcite anticipate variations in the conversion of baryons into stars and the manifestation as starlight at both very low and very high densities .\\ntheoretical considerations prepare us for the possibility of a complex relationship between the distribution of mass and of the lighthouses sitting atop that mass . in this article\\nwe present observational evidence for such complexity .\\nthree environmental regimes will be considered . at home in the local group\\nwe find ourselves in an intermediate regime , common to the majority of spiral galaxies .\\nmost elliptical galaxies find themselves in a high density regime .\\nthen there is a low density regime where galaxies are few or absent .\\nwhat is the relationship between light and mass in each of these three kinds of environments ?\\nvisible galaxies are embedded in halos that extend beyond the radii of observable gas and stars .\\nwe need to go to the scale of groups and clusters to obtain a measure of the total mass of galaxies .\\nthe current investigation relies on the analysis of groups by @xcite ; hereafter t87 .\\nthe individual galaxies associated with the groups in t87 are identified in table ii of @xcite .\\nthis particular group compendium has the attractive features that ( a ) it was constructed with quantitative , well defined rules , ( b ) the groups have been demonstrated to contain few interlopers , and ( c ) a subset has a high level of volume completeness .\\nthe group catalog was constructed through a tree or ` dendogram ' procedure .\\nthe construction begins by looking for the linkage between galaxies that gives the largest value of the product @xmath7 where two candidates @xmath8 and @xmath9 are considered from the ensemble of @xmath10 objects , @xmath11 is the blue luminosity of the brighter candidate , and @xmath12 is the linear separation between the two . for details on the calculation of @xmath12 from angular and radial velocity information\\nsee t87 but essentially , for linkages relevant to group scales , the @xmath12 are based on angular separations only .\\nthe dominant pair that is selected is now inserted back into the catalog as a single unit with the sum of the component luminosities and with position and velocity constructed from the luminosity weighted contributions of the components .\\nthere are now @xmath13 objects to consider and the process is repeated , over and over , until @xmath14 .    in a dendogram\\nconstructed in this manner , ultimately all galaxies under consideration are linked .\\nobviously there is a transition at some point from collections of galaxies that are bound to those that are unbound .\\nthe issue of how to distinguish the bound and unbound domains was the subject of extensive discussion in t87 .\\na crossing time argument was used . at any point in the dendogram\\n, the galaxies that are linked together can be characterized by a separation dimension , the inertial radius @xmath15 , and a velocity dispersion , @xmath16 .\\nthe crossing time @xmath17 ( see t87 for details including corrections for projection ) can be compared with the free expansion timescale , the inverse of the hubble constant , h@xmath18 .\\nunits with @xmath19 have a high probability of being bound .\\nunits with @xmath20 can be inferred to be unbound . with a judicious choice of level , the dendogram could be split between mostly bound and mostly unbound .\\nit would follow from this choice , allowing for measurement and projection errors , that essentially all the merged units that make the dendogram cut on the high density side would have @xmath21 .\\nan interesting aspect of this analysis is that it provides an inventory not only of all the galaxies in a volume that are in groups but also _ all that are not _ in groups . in the sample considered by t87\\nthere was the usual incompletion with distance .\\nhowever a high galactic latitude volume with the distance limit of @xmath22 mpc ( @xmath23 ) has completion in the sense that all galaxies brighter than @xmath24 are included . within this volume ,\\nt87 identified 179 groups of 2 or more galaxies and 49 groups of 5 or more . for statistical robustness\\n, we will restrict most of the following discussion to the groups of 5 or more galaxies ( one of the small groups in t87 has been boosted to above 5 members with our current inventory , giving us 50 groups to consider ) .\\nwe should note a subtle point that arises because the dendogram linkages involve luminosities .\\nlinkages that involve bright galaxies are made more easily , as might well be reasonable if brighter galaxies are more massive .\\nhowever could we miss linkages in cases where mass is underrepresented by light ?\\nthis possibility would potentially undermine the basis of this investigation .\\nit is to be noted that t87 provides a safety net to guard against this concern .\\nin addition to the dendogram cut that resulted in the definition of ` groups ' , a second cut was made an order of magnitude lower in luminosity density that resulted in what were called ` associations ' .\\nwe will first continue with a discussion of the groups but later we will revisit the entities called associations .\\nthe analysis in t87 missed an amazing correlation ! it is seen in figure 1 , which draws on data extracted from t87 and presented here in table 1 .\\nthe data in the left panel represent all the 50 groups in the volume with completion above @xmath24 . in the right panel\\n, symbols distinguish between groups with majority early morphological types ( e - s0-sa : filled squares ) and groups with majority late types ( sab - irr : open circles ) .\\nthere are fewer points in this panel because , in order to make a statistically meaningful distinction in morphological class , we require there be at least 6 galaxies brighter than @xmath25 .\\nthese groups are distinguished by an entry in the third column of table 1 where the percentage type sa or earlier among galaxies brighter than @xmath25 is given .\\nthe numbers of early type groups are small in this restricted local volume , so the slightly more distant early type groups virgo  w , antlia , and ngc 5846 are also considered ( last 3 entries in table 1 ) .\\ngroups with crossing times much less than a hubble time have relatively high mass to light ( @xmath4 ) ratios , values of several hundred in solar units ( masses from t87 are unweighted virial masses following the definition given in section 6 of this paper ) .\\ngroups with crossing times that approach a hubble time have @xmath4 ratios that are much more modest , a few tens in solar units .\\nit is also seen that there is a strong correlation between crossing time and the morphological classification .\\nif the sample is split at a crossing time as a fraction of the hubble timescale of @xmath26 then almost all the groups with shorter crossing times are dominated by early types ( 8 of 9 ) and almost all the groups with longer crossing times are dominated by late types ( 11 of 14 ) .\\ncould the correlation seen in fig .  1 be induced by parameter coupling ?\\nthe vertical axis has dependencies on @xmath27 while the horizontal axis has dependencies @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is a characteristic of the group dimension and @xmath16 is the velocity dispersion .\\nchanges in @xmath16 cause shifts in the sense of the observed correlation .\\nchanges in @xmath29 cause shifts orthogonal to the correlation .\\nthe concern would have to be with @xmath16 values but the typical measurement uncertainties in these values are 20% for the groups in question , much smaller than the factor ten range in crossing time values .\\nmost clearly , though , the correlation can not be an artifact of parameter errors and coupling between the axes because there is a strong correlation between the parameter of either axis in fig .  1 and the morphology of the galaxies .\\nthe qualitative morphological information is decoupled from the measured parameters . in the right panel of fig .  1 , the early type groups have a median crossing time about a factor 3 less and a median @xmath4 about a factor of 3 higher than the late type groups .\\ncould the correlation be an artifact caused by systematic departures from virial equilibrium ?\\npresumably the groups with the shortest crossing times have most closely approached the virial equipartition of energy .\\nthere could be a systematic mis - estimation of mass with the virial approximation that depends on the dynamical age of a system .\\npacheco ( private communication ) has studied the collapse of a group with the expression : @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the moment of inertia of the system , @xmath32 is the kinetic energy in the randomized motions of the constituents , @xmath33 is the kinetic energy in the ordered motions of infall , and @xmath34 is the potential energy .\\npacheco made analytic assumptions about what happens when , during the collapse , violent relaxation @xcite causes the transform of energy from bulk motion to a state approximated by the virial condition .\\ndynamical friction induces the transfer of energy from ordered to random motions .\\nthe approach to equilibrium , with @xmath35 , occurs on the order of one dynamical timescale ( @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the average density of the group within the virial radius ) .\\nmeasurements of groups caught before relaxation would tend to result in underestimates of mass by typically 20% and a factor 2 in the extreme ( theoretically assuming full 3-d information is available ) .\\nthe situation is complex .\\nit was suggested by @xcite that virial mass estimates might be biased low because of segregation as the visible components sink toward the center relative to dark matter .\\nthis possible systematic would increase as the group ages , consequently it would run counter to the correlation seen in fig .  1 .\\nthere is room for further analysis of the properties of groups extracted from cosmological simulations .\\nhigh resolution is required to avoid the concern of artificial 2-body relaxation from massive numerical particles .\\nthere is firmer ground on the observational side .\\nthere is general agreement that groups and clusters with high densities and short dynamical times have @xmath4 values of several hundred .\\nthese circumstances are confirmed by x - ray and gravitational lensing studies .\\nwe suggest that the trend to substantially lower @xmath4 values for systems with longer dynamical times seen in fig .\\n1 is consistent with what is now known from the few detailed studies of low density groups .\\nthe situation is clearest in the local group and has received confirmation from recent studies of the nearest neighboring groups .\\nthese groups are represented in the left panel of fig .  1 but are not sufficiently populated to enter the right panel .\\nthey lie in the lower right corner , with large crossing times and low @xmath4 .\\nthe local group encompasses two dynamical regimes . on a 100  kpc scale ,\\neach of the two major galaxies host a school of minor systems that approximate virial conditions . on a 1  mpc scale\\n, the two major galaxies and ten or so other small galaxies are falling together , most on first approach .\\nthis latter assertion is based on the observation that almost all the local group systems that are not tightly associated with either of the two major galaxies have negative velocities in the local group standard of rest ( ngc 6822 is an exception ) .\\nthe masses of the milky way and andromeda sub - groups can be estimated through the virial theorem since these sub - systems have densities and crossing times that suggest they are dynamically evolved @xcite .\\nthe stellar stream on a scale of 125 kpc around m31 provides a compatible mass estimate @xcite .\\neach sub - group is determined to have @xmath38 .\\nthe mass of the larger infall region can be estimated separately .\\none approach follows the @xcite timing argument .\\na variation on this approach is provided by the identification of the current turnaround radius or zero - velocity surface for the local group @xcite .\\nthere is the important result that the sum of the masses of the andromeda and milky way sub - systems add to approximately the mass determined to lie within the zero - velocity surface of @xmath39 .\\na similar mass is found from orbit reconstructions @xcite .\\nour naive virial estimation ( table 1 : group 14 - 12 ) gives a local group mass of @xmath40 and @xmath41 , in factor 2 agreement with other results .\\nrecent observations of the resolved stars in nearby galaxies with hubble space telescope have dramatically improved our knowledge of distances to many nearby galaxies and hence of the structure of the nearest groups .\\nwe now know that the best studied neighboring groups , those about m81 ( table 1 : group 14 - 10 ) and centaurus  a ( table 1 : group 14 - 15 ) , have dumbbell structures like the local group . in both cases\\nthe two largest galaxies are surrounded by swarms of small galaxies which transit their hosts in times much less than the age of the universe . almost certainly in the case of the m81 group and plausibly in the case of the centaurus group\\n, the substructures are falling together . as with the local group , the masses inferred for the entire bound entities ( 2 and 3 times @xmath2 respectively ) are close to the sum of the masses of the dynamically evolved subcomponents @xcite .\\nthe halos of the giant galaxies must not extend much beyond the domain of the immediate companions and the group @xmath4 values are a few tens .\\nthese groups that are overall spiral rich and low density evidently have @xmath4 values well below 100 .\\nthe virial approximation for these groups , while crude , gives mass estimates that are not strongly deviant .\\nwhile theoretical expectations might cause one to anticipate systematic underestimations of mass assuming the virial approximation , studies of the nearest structures reveal that a crude application of the virial theorem may frequently result in _ overestimations _ of mass .\\nfrequently , unbound objects will be erroneously included as group members .\\nthe availability of good distances to individual galaxies shows that the very nearby sculptor group ( table 1 : 14 - 13 ) and cvn i group ( table 1 : 14 - 07 ) are composites of regions that are unlikely to be bound in the ensemble . the inclusion of expansion velocities and the inflation of group scale cause overestimates of mass .\\nthese effects are pernicious for the extended , low dispersion systems that inhabit the lower right corner of fig .  1 .\\nthe limited information available on morphological variations from studies of nearby groups is giving a hint of higher mass in early type systems .\\nthe kinematics of the sub - group around centaurus  a suggest a mass of @xmath42 and @xmath43 ( albeit including the large spiral ngc 4945 ) while the m83 sub - group is found to have a mass of @xmath40 and @xmath44 .\\nthe elliptical cen  a may have a higher @xmath4 by a factor 23 relative to the large spirals in our vicinity .\\nthe situation in the nearest groups is reviewed by @xcite .\\nfigure 2 shows the correlation between mass and light for the tf87 sample of nearby groups . in the left panel ,\\nall the 50 groups in the volume - limited sample with at least 5 members are represented .\\nthe groups with @xmath45 are plotted with filled squares and the groups with larger crossing times are plotted with open circles .\\nthe 3 more distant early type groups , all with @xmath45 , are plotted as inverted triangles .\\nthe solid line at @xmath46 indicates the mean @xmath4 value determined by t87 for this sample .\\nagain we see that the groups with short crossing times have less blue luminosity per unit of mass .\\nin addition , it can be said that groups with more mass manifest less blue light per unit mass .\\nwe consider the same data in the right panel but now the differentiation is made on the basis of the morphology of the groups .\\nit is seen again that the qualitative morphological description and the quantitative crossing time measure provide an equivalent basis for distinguishing between high and low @xmath4 systems .        the virgo cluster ( group 11 - 1 in tf87 ) and three other specific groups are identified in the left panel of fig .\\nit is instructive to consider the pairwise properties of these groups .\\nit can be seen that the ngc 1407 ( 51 - 8 ) group has roughly the same mass as the ursa major cluster ( group 12 - 1 ) but much lower luminosity .\\nthe ngc  1407 group has the same luminosity as the ngc 1023 ( 17 - 1 ) group but much more mass . these similarities and differences\\nare not in observational doubt .\\nthere is a summary of the properties of these groups in table 1 of @xcite ; see also fig .  1 in that reference for histograms of the group velocities .\\nthe unusual nature of the ngc 1407 group has been noted by @xcite and @xcite .\\nthe group contains only two @xmath47 galaxies but has a velocity dispersion of 385 km  s@xmath48 .\\nthe ursa major cluster , by contrast , has almost enough luminous galaxies to qualify as an abell richness class 0 cluster ! the velocity dispersion , though , is only 148 km  s@xmath48 .\\nthe virial masses of the two groups are almost the same . in the ngc\\n1407 group motions are large in a small volume while in the ursa major cluster motions are low in a large volume . yet\\nthe luminosities differ by a factor 5 and @xmath4 values differ accordingly .\\nthe ngc  1023 group is a scaled down version of the ursa major cluster .\\nthere are three @xmath47 galaxies and the group velocity dispersion is only 57 km  s@xmath48 .\\nthe ngc  1023 and ngc  1407 groups have similar galaxy content in terms of numbers and luminosity ( the type content is late and early , respectively ) .\\nhowever the motions in the ngc  1407 group are a factor of 7 higher .\\nthis difference can not be questioned observationally , and the implied mass of the ngc  1407 group is higher by a factor 30 .    in summary of this section ,\\nevidence is provided of an order of magnitude variation of @xmath4 that depends on mass and/or stage of dynamical evolution .\\nthe derivation of mass from the virial theorem might have biases but there are effects that both raise and lower estimates .\\nthe cases that are particularly well studied provide confirmation of the trends shown in figs .  1 and 2 .\\nthere is a strong inference from numerical action orbit reconstructions that the virgo cluster is very underluminous for its mass compared with the general field . from a first analysis of the local supercluster @xcite with 300 distance estimates as constraints and a later analysis @xcite with 900 distance estimates , it was determined that the mean density of the universe is @xmath49 , consistent with an overall mean @xmath50 assignment . however , as emphasized in the latter paper , it is not possible with a _\\nsingle _ assignment of @xmath4 for all galaxies to obtain a satisfactory model that simultaneously gives a good description of flows in the general vicinity of the local supercluster and a good description of the infall region around the virgo cluster .\\nevidence for this claim is provided in figures 3 and 4 .\\nthe first of these figures show velocity - distance data for galaxies in a group along a specific line - of - sight with respect to the virgo cluster .\\nthe two panels illustrate attempts to fit this data with two distinct numerical action models .\\nthe solid curves represent the run of velocity with distance expected by the separate models . in the left panel , a value @xmath51\\nis assigned to all groups and galaxies .\\nthe location of the galaxy data points in velocity and distance can not be understood in the context of the model in this panel . in the right panel , @xmath52 is assigned to the virgo cluster , and incidentally to all e / s0 knots . in compensation for this increase in the mass of some of the objects , @xmath53 is given all the rest .\\nnow the infall motions toward virgo are greatly enhanced and the model gives a physical basis for the location of this particular group in velocity - distance space .\\nwe see that the group must be slightly nearer than the cluster and falling away from us into the cluster .\\nthe swing in amplitude of the wave in velocity - distance seen in fig .\\n3 ( the ` triple - value ' characteristic @xcite ) depends on the mass assigned to the cluster .\\nit can be seen that the curve in the right panel of fig .  3 only minimally reaches the location of the data points , hence represents a _ minimum _ required mass .\\na larger mass would cause a larger swing and would not be in conflict with the data but is not required .\\n4 shows the constraints provided by many lines - of - sight through the virgo infall region . the individual points record velocity and angular distance from virgo , as open circles for galaxies in the cluster proper ( defined by the ` caustic ' radius established by galaxies that have fallen into the cluster and back out to a second turnaround ) , and as filled circles for galaxies identified to be within the first infall region . to keep the plot clean ,\\ngalaxies at foreground and background ` triple - value ' locations have been rejected based on distance information .\\nthe swings in amplitude of the triple - value waves along various lines - of - sight are indicated by the brackets in the two panels .\\nit is clear that the swing generated by the numerical action model of the left panel , with @xmath51 for all points , fails by a wide margin to explain the infall motions into the virgo cluster .\\nthe model used in the right panel , with @xmath52 given to the virgo cluster and @xmath53 assigned to the field , provides a satisfactory description to the observed data .\\n_ almost a factor 7 higher @xmath4 value is required for the virgo cluster than for the general field . _\\nthe evidence for a lot of mass in the cluster which comes from the extended nature of the infall region ( extending to @xmath54 from the center of the cluster or 8 mpc ) and high infall velocities ( galaxies hit the caustic surface of the cluster at @xmath55 with a velocity of 1500 km  s@xmath48 ) requires a remarkable @xmath56 within the 2 mpc caustic surface of second turnaround .\\nthis mass is almost twice the virial mass estimate but it pertains to a radius three times larger than the virial radius .\\nthe infall mass estimate pertains to the cluster on it s largest scale .\\nit can be noted that a similar conclusion was reached much earlier @xcite with a non - linear but spherically symmetric analytic model of virgo cluster infall .\\nthe very same conclusions were reached that there had to be a lot of mass for the amount of light in the cluster but much less mass with respect to light in the supercluster environs surrounding the cluster .\\nthe preferred model in the @xcite analysis used two discrete @xmath4 assignments : @xmath52 was assigned to 12 e - s0 dominated groups including the virgo cluster and @xmath53 was assigned otherwise .\\n( the action models do not provide constraints on the masses of the e - s0 groups smaller than virgo because the triple value regions are too restricted to map infall .\\nthe large @xmath4 assignments for these groups were based on the virial information discussed earlier . )\\nit was concluded that @xmath49 associated with galaxies in the mean but that the virgo cluster in particular must have a much higher @xmath4 value than the mean . the numerical action mean result for the field ( @xmath53 ) and the large mass for virgo ( @xmath57 )\\nare recorded in the right panel of fig .  2 .\\nas an aside , it should be noted that what is meant by the terms ` group ' and ` cluster ' are not well defined , other than that there is the inference that the structures are bound . in the case of the local group , it was discussed that there is a zero - velocity surface at @xmath58  mpc radius @xcite .\\nthis surface defines a bound domain and provides a logical limit to the group .\\nhowever , the local group is certainly not virialized over this domain . at most ,\\nthere may be limited quasi - virialized regimes within @xmath59  kpc about each of the two dominant galaxies . by contrast\\n, when we talk about the virgo cluster we certainly do not consider it to extend to the current zero - velocity surface which lies on the near side at about half the distance from us to the cluster core .\\nrather , a good working definition of the volume of the cluster is the domain within the first caustic , the outer limit of objects that have completed a single passage .\\nthe cluster is not virialized to this radius but the approach toward virialization will be greater within a cluster defined this way than in the local group analog .\\nthe discussion to this point , involving the properties of groups and the inferences drawn from modeling of flow patterns in the local supercluster , has dealt with comparisons between intermediate and high density regimes .\\nattention will now turn to lower density environments .\\nthe algorithm for the selection of groups used by t87 contained luminosity .\\ncould we loose real groups because their constituents are underluminous ?\\nwe have just been arguing that groups with short crossing times and dominated by early type galaxies are environments that are underluminous compared with the environments of groups with crossing times approaching a hubble time and dominated by spirals and irregulars .\\nfortunately , no groups of the former type would have been missed in the construction of the group catalog because the e / s0 groups with short crossing times have considerably higher spatial densities than the spiral groups .\\nconsequently they comfortably cross the luminosity density threshold set for the group catalog even though they turn out to be underluminous . in the years that have passed since\\nthe catalog was developed we have never become aware of a high spatial density but low luminosity group in the volume of our sample that escaped identification .\\nhowever we can not be so sanguine in the limit of low spatial densities .\\nindeed , among the entities called ` associations ' that came out of the t87 study there were some that look suspiciously like the entities identified as groups .\\nthe dimensions of these units are only several hundred kiloparsecs , like the groups .\\nthey can have _ very low _ velocity dispersions , comparable with the lowest values in the established groups . _ their members are all dwarfs .\\n_ they were not picked up in the groups analysis because they have very low luminosities .\\nif they are bound groups then the associated @xmath4 is much larger than is familiar to us from our experience with the intermediate regime spiral groups .\\nour interest in these entities was rekindled by work from a very different direction .\\nwe were interested in possible environmental dependencies at the faint end of the luminosity function of galaxies .\\nit seems that there are unexpectedly few dwarf galaxies compared with the expectations of the standard hierarchical model for galaxy formation @xcite@xcite .\\nwe suggested that the deficiency with respect to the standard model might be greater at lower densities @xcite , hereafter tstv .\\nthere might be an expectation that there are many low mass dark matter halos floating about with little or no gas and stars .\\nwe speculated that there might be a possibility to identify the dynamical manifestations of such halos in a certain special environment .\\nthese low mass dark halos would not be of sufficient consequence to be noticed in our standard groups , even those as modest as the local group . at a mass and density regime well below that of the local group , according to the hypothesis that we are pursuing that low mass halos are voided of gas and stars , then there would be nothing to be seen .\\nhowever , in the interval _ between _ the normal groups and putative much smaller structures it might be expected that _ there are groups that are mostly , but not entirely dark . _    as discussed in tstv , it occurred to us that the ` mostly dark ' groups that could be anticipated from theoretical grounds might be found among the subset of associations in the t87 study with group - like dimensions and low velocity dispersions but high implied @xmath4 values .\\nwe drew attention to four such groups thought to lie within 5 mpc .\\nthe key issue regarding these ` groups of dwarfs ' that we identify is whether they are bound . _\\nif they are bound then they must have high @xmath4 values .\\n_ in order to illuminate this issue , we have been involved in programs to identify other potential group members and to get good distances to individual objects .\\nthese galaxies are all near enough that they are easily resolved with hubble space telescope ( hst ) and distances can be established from the luminosities of stars at the tip of the red giant branch @xcite , the ` trgb ' distance method .\\nwe first review the present status of these programs .\\nat the time of the paper by tstv , good distances were only known for members of one of the four putative groups of dwarfs .\\nnow there are reasonable distances from the trgb method based on hst images for _ most of the galaxies in all of the groups_. the new distances are reported in the following publications : @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .\\nthe updated results are summarized in table  2 for the four candidate groups of dwarfs and one additional comparison group .\\nno weighting is applied in the calculation of the dimension , velocity , and mass parameters since it is assumed that the individual galaxies are inconsequential test particles in the potential of the group .\\nthe following information is provided in the table .\\n( 1 ) group name from @xcite . ( 2 )\\nprominent galaxy in group .\\n( 3 ) number of candidate group members . ( 4 ) mean group distance .\\n( 5 ) inertial radius @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the 3-dimensional distance of a galaxy from the group centroid . ( 6 ) radial velocity dispersion @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the radial velocity difference between a galaxy and the group mean ( 7 ) blue luminosity .\\n( 8) `` projected mass estimate ''\\n@xmath64 @xcite where @xmath65 ( tstv ) and @xmath66 . ( 9 ) virial mass estimate @xmath67 where @xmath68 and @xmath69 is the separation between pairs in the group counted only once .\\nthe factor 3 gives the statistical conversion from the observed radial velocity to 3-dimensions .\\nradii are already provided in 3-dimensions because of the availability of distances .\\n( 10 ) mass to light ratio based on the projected mass estimator . ( 11 ) mass to light ratio based on the virial analysis .\\n( 12 ) mass to light ratio given by tstv .\\n( 13 ) crossing time as a fraction of the hubble time @xmath70 where @xmath71 is in mpc and @xmath72 is in km  s@xmath48 and @xmath73 km  s@xmath48  mpc@xmath48 .    in tstv ,\\nonly the projected mass estimator of @xcite was considered .\\nhere we also provide the unweighted virial mass estimator . there can be circumstances with small numbers where the virial mass estimator gives ambiguous results ; see the case of the ngc 3109 group discussed below .\\nhowever the use of the two mass estimators provides a better feel for the considerable uncertainties .\\nthe @xmath4 values determined by tstv are carried for convenience into table 2 .\\nit can be seen that @xmath4 values have increased slightly overall with the current analysis .\\na principal cause of this small increase was a mistake in corrections to luminosities of galaxies in tstv .\\nin that paper the luminosities had corrections for obscuration based on the prescription by @xcite . however , the obscuration in dwarf galaxies is sufficiently low as to be unmeasurable @xcite . in this paper ,\\nno correction is made for obscuration within galaxies with @xmath74 .\\nthe result is that luminosities are systematically lowered and @xmath4 values are increased .\\ncorrections are made for obscuration due to lines of sight through our galaxy @xcite . in any event ,\\nthe luminosities of dwarf galaxies are often poorly known .\\nerrors in the group luminosities of up to 30% are possible , but errors at this level do not bring the conclusions of this study into question . here\\nare comments on the situation in individual groups .    _\\n14 + 12 = ngc 3109 group : _ the existence of this nearby entity as a distinct group was suggested by @xcite . in our earlier analysis\\nwe entertained that gr8 = ddo 155 might be a member but this galaxy is significantly farther away than was assumed by tstv , at 2.24 mpc rather than 1.51 mpc @xcite .\\nthis galaxy is also , by a substantial amount , the farthest removed from the other group candidates on the plane of the sky .\\nconsequently , we eliminate this object from consideration as a group member .\\nmoreover the object lsbc d634 - 03 is now revealed to be a background galaxy coincident with an hi high velocity cloud .\\nthe other 4 candidates are still considered at the distances given in tstv . in the case of this group ,\\nthe virial mass estimator is particularly untrustworthy because two of the candidates are very close neighbors ; ngc 3109 and antlia are separated by 29 kpc . since @xmath75 , the single pair dominates by an order of magnitude over the next pair in the calculation of the scale of the potential well .\\nif the separation of this pair is arbitrarily set to 100 kpc , still smaller than any other separation in the group , then the virial mass estimate doubles .\\nthere is a chronic ambiguity in the virial mass estimator with small numbers and instances of close pairs .\\nhowever , only this one group suffers this problem among the cases we are considering .\\noverall , the viability of the 14 + 12 candidate group remains as it was with the discussion by tstv , with an implied @xmath76 if the entity is bound .    _\\n14 + 8 = ugc 8760 group : _ distance measurements have revealed that this group is much closer than the @xmath77  mpc that we expected .\\nthere are now trgb distances for all the candidates , including a new and provisionary one for ugc 8760 itself .\\nbeing closer , the linear separations are smaller than we appreciated .\\nalso we have become aware of a fourth system , ugc 9240 , which also is probably associated .\\nthe three well measured distances are very similar ( ugc 8651 at 3.01 mpc ; ugc 8833 at 3.19 mpc ; ugc 9240 at 2.79 mpc ) .\\nthe first two were associated with the group by tstv and it is a powerful claim for the reality of the group that they both have unexpectedly low and similar distances .\\na nice test for the hypothesis being pursued is that the distance of ugc 8760 be also low and an hst observation returned as this paper goes to press reveals ugc  8760 to be at @xmath78  mpc .\\nit is seen in table  2 that the new @xmath4 values are consistent between methods and considerably larger than found previously .\\nthe difference from the tstv results is most marked in this case .\\npart of this increase is a direct consequence of the downward revision in distance ; @xmath4 is inversely dependent on distance .\\nthe other causes are the addition of the fourth candidate member and the changes to luminosities discussed above .\\na value @xmath79 is required if the entity is bound .    _\\n14 + 19 = ugc 3974 group : _ all four candidate members now have trgb distance measures and they all turn out to have distances similar to our expectation of @xmath77  mpc ( ugc 3755 at 5.0  mpc ; ugc 3974 at 5.2  mpc ; ugc 4115 at 5.5  mpc ; kk98 65 at 4.5  mpc ) .\\nthese galaxies are rather at the limit of the trgb method with the hst wfpc detector in one orbit so the uncertainties are larger in these distances .\\neven so , contributions to the scale of the group from distances and projected separations are comparable .\\nagain @xmath4 values are larger than found before .\\nthe earlier result was based on the projected mass estimator with 2-d positions and particularly uncertain luminosities .\\nthe current analysis has revised luminosities and 3-d positions . giving consideration to both mass estimators\\n, the current information suggests @xmath80 if the group is bound .    _\\n17 + 6 = ngc 784 group : _ all 4 candidates have trgb distances now although those for ngc 784 and ugc 1281 are unpublished and poor quality .\\nthe agreement is satisfactory and give a mean distance of 5.0  mpc , as was initially anticipated .\\n( ugc 1281 at 4.8  mpc , ngc 784 at 4.6  mpc , kk98 16 at 5.7  mpc ; kk98 17 at 5.0  mpc ) .\\nthe factor 3 larger @xmath4 than previously is attributable to the correction to luminosities and the distance differentials that reveal this group is extended more in the line - of - sight than in projection . if the group is bound then @xmath79 .    _\\n14 + 13 = foreground sculptor group , a comparison case : _ this structure was included in the discussion by tstv . in the past ,\\nseveral of the galaxies have been considered as part of the sculptor group but we consider this historical group to consist of two distinct entities . we give attention to the nearer part .\\none good new candidate is added to the group specified by tstv : eso 294 - 010 .\\nall but the group s most luminous galaxy , ngc 55 , have measured distances now ( eso 294 - 010 at 1.92  mpc ; ngc 300 at 2.00  mpc ; ugca  438 at 2.23  mpc ; ic  5152 at 2.07  mpc ) .\\nresults are little different than previously .\\nthe mass estimates are as low as for any of the groups discussed above because of the very low velocity dispersion .\\nhowever there are two moderate galaxies in the group so there is substantial luminosity . ic  5152\\nis removed by 770  kpc from the group centroid , mostly in projection , so the status of this object is in doubt . whether or not it is included , if the entity is assumed to be bound then @xmath81 .\\nthe candidate groups have mass estimates in the modest range @xmath82 .\\ncharacteristic dimensions range 290  kpc  @xmath83 540  kpc with a mean of 420  kpc , typical of more familiar groups ( t87 ) .\\nvelocity dispersions range from 36  km  s@xmath48 down to an incredibly low 13  km  s@xmath48 with a mean of 22  km  s@xmath48 .\\nthese values are all very low compared to familiar luminous groups and account for the low mass estimates .\\nluminosities are all in the decade @xmath84 except for the comparison case of the 14 + 13 or foreground sculptor group which has almost an order of magnitude more luminosity than the most luminous of the others .\\ncrossing times as a fraction of the hubble time are given in the last column of table  2 .\\ntypically values are @xmath85 . of course\\n, the crossing times are long because the velocity dispersions are so low .\\nthey are a sufficiently large fraction of the age of the universe that one can worry that velocities are simply attributable to the expansion of the universe ; ie , that these are not bound groups . only in the case of the tight 17 + 6 ( ngc 784 )\\ngroup is the crossing time substantially less than a hubble time , h@xmath86 .\\nif ic  5152 is accepted as part of the 14 + 13 ( foreground sculptor ) group then the crossing time for this group is 50% longer than h@xmath86 , but this is the comparison case : a group with low @xmath4 .    to this point there has been almost no discussion of uncertainties .\\nfirst , it is to be emphasized that the measurement errors in the observed parameters are of almost no consequence .\\nthe radial velocities are obtained by observations of the 21 cm line of hi and for these dwarfs are determined with an accuracy of @xmath87  km  s@xmath48 .\\nthe distances are determined with the trgb method .\\nthere might be a distance scale zero point issue at the level of 10% that would shift the entire sample in a similar fashion and not affect this discussion .\\nrelatively , the distances should be accurate to 5% for galaxies within 3 mpc .\\nthere is a degradation to @xmath88 at 5 mpc .\\nhowever in none of the groups discussed here is the depth of the group dominant over the projected dimensions .\\nhence errors in measured dimensions do not make a significant contribution to uncertainties .\\nthe most poorly known direct observables are the luminosities .\\nthe global group luminosities attributable to the identified candidates can have errors as large as 30% .\\nthe luminosities come from heterogeneous sources , some with large errors .\\nthe situation could be improved with dedicated observations .\\nstill , the real uncertainties lie elsewhere .\\nthe greatest uncertainty of all is whether or not the groups are bound .\\nassuming for the moment that they are , then there are four dominant uncertainties in the calculation of a group mass : ( a ) small number statistics , ( b ) the statistics of velocity deprojection from one to three dimensions , ( c ) potentially poor coverage of the group gravitational well , and ( d ) the nature of the galaxy orbits .\\nthe first two of these problems lead to uncertainties that are statistical in nature .\\nthe groups under consideration have 4 or 5 candidate members each .\\nthe number of pairs grows as @xmath89 so each additional candidate gives a big improvement . as for the velocity deprojection problem , recall that mass calculation involves @xmath90 and the deprojection correction is a factor 3 .\\nthe latter two problems raise possibilities of systematic errors in the mass calculations . with regard to the question of coverage of the group potential well ,\\none aspect is simply the limited coverage with only 4 or 5 test particles and another aspect is the uncertainty in the limits of the putative bounded regions .\\ndo the candidates at larger radii represent those limits , or are they frequently beyond those limits and escaping ? finally , there is the nature of the galaxy orbits .\\nare they isotropized to a degree as would occur as a system approaches virialization or are they largely radial as would be expected of a group still in formation , with orbits dominated by infall ?\\nthe alternatives have different implications for the projected velocities . following the assumption of the virial theorem : @xmath91 , where the kinetic energy per unit mass is @xmath92 and\\nthe potential energy per unit mass is @xmath93 ( see section 6 ) .\\nthe possibility of systematic departures from the virial condition was discussed in section 3 . both from analytic and n - body simulations @xcite it is found that mean values of @xmath94 evolve from small values at turnaround to @xmath58 at first collapse , to ratios up to 20% above unity , whence there is a slow approach to virialization from values above 1 .\\nthere can be large excursions in individual cases .\\nthe results of this paper could require modification due to this probable systematic effect .\\ndense groups that are well advanced toward virialization will tend to have @xmath94 greater than unity by @xmath95 so mass estimates will be above true values while groups that are still collapsing will tend to have @xmath94 less than unity by up to a factor 2 so mass estimates will be below true values .\\ngiven the other large sources of errors , the uncertainty regarding the dynamical state is not dominant so the virial condition will be assumed .\\nmass estimates have been calculated two ways , following the discussion by @xcite . except in the special case of the 14 + 12 ( ngc 3109 ) group that received discussion ,\\nthe two mass estimates for a group differ from the mean by no more than 35% . if it is simply assumed that the group is bound then one gets a _ lower mass limit _ which is one - half the virial estimate . in the plots that will be shown further along , factor 3 uncertainties in mass\\nhave been assumed for groups with 4 candidates .\\neven the very large uncertainties that have been discussed do not bring into question the fundamental claim being made pertaining to the low density regime .\\n_ if the candidate dwarf groups are bound then high @xmath4 values are required for the groups .\\n_ we can think of two arguments that favor the point of view that the groups are bound .\\nthe first notes the continuity in properties with well established groups in terms of dimensions and velocity dispersions .\\nthese properties are illustrated in figure  5 . to a reasonable degree , the e / s0 dominated groups and spiral dominated groups separate on this plot .\\nthe early - type groups tend to be restricted spatially but can manifest large velocity dispersions while the late - type groups inevitably have modest velocity dispersions but can be dispersed spatially ( there are a few groups with majority early types with the properties of the spiral groups ) .\\nthe candidate dwarf groups can be viewed as an extension of the distribution of the groups dominated by spirals .\\nthere is nothing to suggest from these parameters that characterize the dynamical state that the dwarf groups are other than a continuation of the family of bound groups to lower masses .\\nit is only when attention is given to the luminosities of the systems that one appreciates that the situation is quite different from the familiar .\\nthe second argument draws on the highly correlated nature of the distribution of dwarf galaxies . within 5 mpc , most known dwarfs are members of the few well established groups ( 14 - 7 : cvn  i group ; 14 - 10 : m81 group ;\\n14 - 11 : maffei / ic  342 group ; 14 - 12 : local group ; 14 - 13 : sculptor group ; 14 - 15 : centaurus group ) and most of the rest are associated with a few relatively isolated bright galaxies or are members of the dwarf groups that have been identified .\\nthe current census of the sky for dwarf galaxies is mainly due to the hard work extracting candidates from the second palomar observatory sky survey in the northern sky and the eso / serc survey of the southern sky by karachentseva and collaborators @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , with hi follow up reported in @xcite and earlier papers .\\nthe hi parkes all sky survey ( hipass ) is providing an independent search of the southern part of the sky @xcite .\\n@xcite provide a tabulation of 156 galaxies , big and small , identified to exist between 1 and 5.5 mpc of us ( hence excludes the local group ) .\\nfully 101 of the objects are associated with the well established groups identified in the previous paragraph .\\nanother 13 are associated with relatively isolated luminous galaxies and 6 are associated with somewhat more distant groups or are at very low galactic latitude .\\nthen there are the 21 galaxies we associate with the groups of dwarfs or the comparison 14 + 13 ( ngc 55 ) group . that leaves only 15 low luminosity galaxies remaining through the rest of the volume .\\nseveral of these are in close proximity to one another .\\nthe strong correlation in position of the nearby galaxies is illustrated in figure  6 .\\nthe top panel shows the two - point correlation function for all known galaxies at @xmath96 within 5 mpc , excluding the local group within 1.1 mpc .\\ngood distances exist for a majority of these galaxies , and rough distances exist for the rest , so what is shown here is the three - dimensional two - point function .\\nnormalization was achieved by comparison with 1000 monte carlo random distributions within the volume .\\nthe strong positive correlation at separations less than 1 mpc is dominated by the contributions from the well known nearby galaxy groups .\\nthe bottom panel in fig . 6 examines the two - point correlation when contributions from the dominant groups have been excised . in this case ,\\nspheres of radius 1.4 mpc have been defined centered on the 5 dominant nearby high latitude groups : those associated with m81 , cvn  i , centaurus , sculptor , and ngc 1313 ( the maffei group lies at low latitude as does a majority of the centaurus group ) .\\nthe 80% of the volume that remains ( 220 mpc@xmath97 ) contains 30% of the original sample ( 42 galaxies ) .\\nthe foreground sculpter and three of four of our candidate dwarf groups are in the remaining volume , contributing 17 of the 42 galaxies ( the 14 + 19 group lies at low galactic latitude ; in fact the fussy @xmath96 limit was chosen to allow inclusion of the entire 17 + 6 group ) .\\nit is seen that even when the historically known groups are eliminated there is still a strong correlation signal at separations less than 1 mpc . the signal at separations less than 0.5 mpc is 63% of the signal in the top panel .\\nthis signal is dominated by the correlations within the four low mass candidate groups .\\nthe positive correlation signal at separations greater than 9 mpc has an easy explanation .\\nthe monte carlo normalization assumes objects are distributed randomly throughout the available volume but in fact most nearby galaxies lie in the supergalactic equatorial plane .\\nthe signal at large separations comes from cross - correlations from opposite ends of the equatorial plane , between the 17 + 6 members and galaxies in the region of the centaurus group on the one hand and between galaxies in the vicinity of the sculptor group with those near cvn  i and near centaurus . in this small sample ,\\nonly 3 - 4 galaxies in each of these regions is enough to create the spurious cross - correlation signal .\\nthe weaker signal at large separations in the top panel arises from the same source : the concentration of local galaxies to a plane .\\nthe present analysis is preliminary because the census of dwarfs is still uncertain .\\nit is still not clear that even the high latitude sky has been uniformly surveyed .\\nit is not clear how rapidly candidates are lost with galactic latitude .\\nhi signals for objects with velocities near zero can be lost in the confusion of galactic emission .\\nour knowledge of the distances of candidates is improving rapidly with hst imaging but is still very incomplete .\\non the basis of present information the dwarf groups that have been identified are manifest enhancements over a random distribution .\\nthey correlate comparably well as the galaxies in previously established groups .\\nthe small dimensions of the dwarf groups and the highly significant 2-point correlation signal on scales @xmath98 mpc suggest that the groups of dwarfs are bound . given that proposition , we can add the information from the low density regime to the data from the intermediate and high density regime shown in fig .\\nthe combined data is seen in figure 7 .\\nt87 groups of 2 - 4 members are added to provide information about the situation at low luminosities , though mass estimates are very uncertain for these entities .\\nthe four groups of dwarfs are plotted with error bars in mass .\\nthey lie at luminosities below @xmath99 and well below the dotted @xmath4 constant line .\\nthe comparison 14 + 13 ( ngc 55 ) group lies in the same mass range but at higher luminosity , well above the dotted line .\\nthe solid curve was fit to the ensemble of data .\\nthe curve corresponds to the expression : @xmath100 this equation relates luminosity and mass with 3 constraints : a logarithmic slope at the high mass end , @xmath101 , a low mass exponential cutoff set by @xmath102 , and a normalization , @xmath103 .\\nthe curve was fit by minimizing a @xmath104 with uncertainties taken in mass only : @xmath105 here , @xmath106 is the mass in the relationship described by eq .\\n( 2 ) at the luminosity @xmath107 of group @xmath8 , with measured mass @xmath108 .\\nthe @xmath104 normalization is given the dependence on the number of group members @xmath10 according to the formulation @xmath109 .\\na weighting that favors groups with large @xmath10 more than the statistical @xmath110 is justified by the expected better approximation to a virialized state for the larger groups and to compensate for the small numbers of large @xmath10 systems .\\nthe absolute normalization of the @xmath104 evaluator is arbitrary : we simply search for the lowest value .\\nwe set @xmath111 for the traditional groups and @xmath112 for the groups of dwarfs ; ie , give double weight to the groups of dwarfs because they are drawn from a restricted region and are few in number .        the curve superimposed on the data in fig .\\n7 has a slope at the high mass end of @xmath113 .\\nit can be appreciated that taking errors only in mass leads to a steeper slope than if errors are distributed into luminosity . at the low mass end\\nthe curve demonstrates an exponential cutoff characterized by @xmath114 .\\nthe normal luminous groups with 5 or more members only provide information at masses @xmath115 .\\ngroups of 24 members provide information at lower luminosities and masses but at the cost of large uncertainties in mass .\\nthe evidence for the cutoff comes from the four candidate dwarf groups . in the absence of the dwarf groups\\nwe might be left to suppose that there is simply a lower limit to the mass range of groups . however , from fig .\\n7 we instead infer that smaller mass groups do exist but groups are not manifested by the light of stars at very low masses .\\nthe break is more dramatically represented in figure 8 .\\nthis plot shows the same data but the vertical axis gives the departure from a @xmath46 line in the previous plot .\\nlarge errors in masses in small groups create diagonal scatter in this plot .\\nthe inference we draw from the foreground sculptor group , with very low @xmath116 , is that there is tremendous real scatter in the baryon content of halos in the proximity of the mass cutoff .\\ninterestingly , both @xcite and @xcite have deduced a similar dependence between mass and light from observations of the luminosity function of galaxies derived from redshift surveys and the assumption that the underlying halo mass function follows the modified press - schechter description of @xcite .\\nthe deduction follows from the observation that , compared with the mass function , the luminosity function is shallower at the faint end and cuts off more abruptly at the bright end , implying @xmath117 increases at the two extremes relative to the intermediate range .        to conclude\\n, we take a look at the mass function in the volume with @xmath118 and a distance limit of @xmath22  mpc ( distances from a numerical action velocity field model ) and the fraction of the total mass lying in specific environments .\\nthis information is summarized in figure 9 .\\nthe mass function incorporates all the groups involved in the earlier discussion , plus contributions from galaxies that lie outside any of these groups .\\nwe have no information on the extended mass around individual galaxies but for the purpose of constructing this mass function it is assumed that @xmath119 .\\nthe contribution of the individual galaxies by number is given by the figures in brackets in fig .\\nit is seen that the individual galaxies only become dominant in their contribution below @xmath2 and with our @xmath4 assumption for the individual galaxies their contribution to the overall mass budget is small .    the mass function shown in fig .\\n9 becomes incomplete below @xmath2 .\\nthe error bars only reflect the statistical uncertainty associated with the observed contributions . to get an estimate of the contribution to the total mass budget of low mass groups we consider the restricted volume within 5  mpc . in this volume\\nthere are 5 groups of luminous galaxies , excluding the low latitude 14 - 11 ( maffei / ic  342 ) group , and these groups cumulatively contain about @xmath120 .\\nthree high latitude luminous galaxies unassociated with significant groups ( ngc 1313 , ngc 3621 , and ngc 6503 ) , if assumed to have an associated @xmath121 , would contain about @xmath122 in their vicinity .\\nthe five low mass groups discussed here would cumulatively contain about @xmath123 .\\nroughly @xmath124 of the mass related to observable galaxies within 5 mpc would lie in the major groups , almost 90% would be associated in some way with luminous galaxies , and only about 12% would be in the regions of the groups of dwarfs . although the number of groups associated with low mass halos are comparable to the number of familiar groups in the local region , they contribute only a small fraction of the mass .\\nhence the inventory of the mass of the universe tied up in bound structures represented by fig .\\n9 is unlikely to be seriously in error at the low mass end .\\nthe histogram of mass fractions by mass interval seen in fig .\\n9 can be summarized as follows .\\nfully 40% of the mass in this local volume is in the single object , the virgo cluster ( clearly , the high mass end of the mass function is poorly determined in such a restricted volume ) .\\nthe groups that have short crossing times and are dominated by e / s0/sa galaxies ( including virgo ) contain 60% of the mass .\\nlooking at groups of all types , 90% of the mass is in groups with @xmath125 .\\nthe luminous groups within 5 mpc all lie essentially within the mass bin @xmath126 , on the tail of the histogram seen in fig .\\n9 . yet even with respect to such groups ,\\nthe low mass groups within 5 mpc make only a minor contribution to the mass budget .\\nit can be concluded that they do not contain an important fraction of the mass of the universe .\\nthere is surprisingly strong evidence for variations in the relationship between blue light and mass as a function of environment . on the scale of groups ,\\nthe lowest @xmath4 values are found on mass scales of @xmath0 where typical values are @xmath1 .\\ngroups in this mass range are almost always composed of late type galaxies with ongoing star formation .\\ngroups with higher mass produce less blue light .\\nthe trend is enhanced by the local density as identified by the crossing time .\\nhigh density regions , those with short crossing times , are darker .\\nthe morphology of the group members is highly correlated with these trends : groups with predominantly e / s0/sa systems have short crossing times and large @xmath4 .\\nthis pattern is consistent with a picture in which dense regions formed earlier and today star formation is largely exhausted in these places .\\nthe stellar populations are fainter and redder . possibly in these environments there\\nhave been multiple collisions between galaxies that have scattered many stars into the intracluster environment where their light goes undetected in our light inventory .\\nthen it is certainly known that the dense environments of e / s0 groups and clusters glow with thermal x - ray emission , to the degree that most of the baryons in these environments are in the hot intracluster gas and not in stars .\\ntogether , these astrophysical processes could explain the observed factor of 7 increase in @xmath4 in proceeding from spiral dominated groups in the mass range @xmath0 to e / s0 dominated groups in the mass range @xmath127 .    at the other end of the mass spectrum , below @xmath2 , there is a cutoff in the visible manifestations of groups .\\none unlikely possibility is that there simply are few groups with less mass than @xmath2 .\\na more likely possibility is that group halos of lower mass exist but are difficult to identify because of a deficiency of light .\\nwe have presented evidence that such low mass groups might be common .\\nthe number of such groups that can be identified within 5  mpc are comparable to the number of luminous groups .\\nthe deficiency of light is very great in these cases , assuming that the groups are bound .\\ngroups in the mass range @xmath3 can have @xmath4 values 5 to 20 times higher than the groups of spiral galaxies in the range @xmath0 .\\nthe possibility is open that there may be halos in the dwarf group mass range and lower that are totally invisible .    as an aside , if the hypothesis of this paper is correct that groups of dwarfs are bound then the two decade old controversy between the alternatives of dark matter versus non - newtonian gravity ( milgrom 1983 ) is definitively resolved .\\nit is implausible that the groups of dwarfs are bound by stars or gas .\\nthe relationship between the observable constituents and the gravitational field is quite unlike that of more luminous groups .\\nthe transform between light and mass is being shown to be complex .\\nof particular cosmological importance is the sharp trend toward darkness at high mass .\\nthe virgo cluster has 40% of the mass attributed to groups in the volume of our study but it only contributes 15% of the blue light .\\nthe rich clusters have a dynamic importance much greater than would be expected from their light .\\nby contrast , though there is evidence that low mass groups may be rendered almost or completely invisible , their cumulative contribution to the clustered mass of the universe seems to be small . to the limit that it can be traced ,\\nthe mass function is too flat for low mass structures to make a substantial contribution to the inventory of mass .\\nthe work over the years involving the numerical action modeling has involved a happy collaboration with jim peebles and , especially , ed shaya .\\nmy principal collaborator on work at the faint end of the galaxy luminosity function is neil trentham .\\njose pacheco has provided valuable insight regarding the dynamic state of unrelaxed structures .\\nthis research is being supported by jpl contract 1243647 and stsci awards hst - go-09162 and hst

      "texts:  [b'the formation of s0 galaxies is generally discussed in the framework of mergers of disk galaxies within a lambda cold dark matter ( @xmath4cdm ) cosmology . alternatively , they can be viewed as former spirals where star formation has ceased and gas lost by stripping mechanisms . however , less attention has been paid to the role of bars in the evolution of these galaxies .\\nbars are known to be efficient drivers of gas towards the central regions of galaxies , and in the presence of nuclear bars @xcite or nuclear spirals , a central starburst might occur .\\nnumerical simulations @xcite also predict that bars evolve due to angular momentum transfer between the bar and a massive or centrally concentrated halo , leading to more prominent bars .\\nindeed , there is observational evidence that bars in early - type disk galaxies might be more evolved than bars in spiral galaxies .\\nthey are longer @xcite , more massive , and have more frequently double - peaked fourier amplitude profiles @xcite and ansae - type morphologies @xcite . in the above simulation models\\nthese features can be interpreted as indices of evolved bars .\\nlenses are features commonly observed in s0 galaxies , but are sometimes also seen in early - type spirals .\\nthey are defined as components with a shallow or constant surface brightness profile , and a sharp outer edge .\\nlenses are a fundamental part of the original classification of s0s @xcite , although they were not recognized initially with their own type symbol .\\novals are global deviations of the disk from the axisymmetric shape . in distinction to bars they have lower ellipticities and generally lack higher order fourier terms than @xmath5=2 .\\nwe emphasize the importance of ovals and lenses for understanding bar - induced galaxy evolution .\\n@xcite showed that 54@xmath3 of barred galaxies of types sb0-sba have lenses .\\nthe actual frequency of lenses in non - barred s0s was not determined at that time , although strong lenses were known to exist in such galaxies @xcite .\\nour recent studies ( laurikainen et al . 2005 , 2007 ) have confirmed that lenses are common in non - barred s0s .\\nit was first suggested by @xcite that lenses might be destroyed or weakened bars . if bars evolve in the hubble sequence , and lenses are indeed weakened bars , at some stage one would expect the fraction of lenses to exceed the fraction of bars .\\nit is also challenging to explain the origin of the multiple bars , ovals and lenses seen in single s0s and for which no explanation has yet been given in the current paradigm of galaxy formation . in this letter\\nthe origin of s0 galaxies is discussed , based on an analysis of 127 early - type disk galaxies ( laurikainen et al .\\n2005 , 2006 ) : n(s0)=82 , n(s0/a)=18 , n(sa - sab)=27 .\\nalthough by far most s0s might be descendants of spiral galaxies , we present evidence that bars , ovals and lenses have played an important role in their structure formation and evolution .\\nsupport for the stripped spiral hypothesis is provided by a clear correlation between bulge and disk scale parameters ( section 4 ) .\\nthe role of bars in structure formation is evidenced by the large number of ovals+lenses ( interpreted as weakened bars ) in s0s , and by the massive disk - like bulges found in nine of the galaxies ( sections 3 and 5 ) .\\nthe studied galaxies are part of a magnitude - limited near - ir s0 galaxy survey ( nirs0s ) , which has the following selection criteria : @xmath6 @xmath7 12.5 , inclination @xmath7 65@xmath8 , and hubble type @xmath93 @xmath7 @xmath10 @xmath7 1 @xcite .\\nmore than half of the 184 nirs0s galaxies are currently analyzed , which form an adequate sample to study the structural components of these galaxies .\\nwe show 2-dimensional decompositions of the surface brightness distribution for two oval / lens - dominated galaxies , with the following aims : ( 1 ) to show how to identify lenses in galaxies , ( 2 ) to stress the importance of accounting for bright ovals / lenses while deriving the parameters of the bulge , and , ( 3 ) to demonstrate the complexity of some s0 galaxies that needs to be explained by galaxy evolutionary models .\\nour decompositions use a sersic function for the bulge , allowing for its flattening and deviation from elliptical isophotes , an exponential function for the disk , and either a sersic or ferrers function for the bars , ovals and lenses . in this study\\ntwo types of bulges are considered : ( 1 ) classical elliptical - like bulges ( with sersic index @xmath11 near 4 ) , and ( 2 ) disk - like pseudobulges ( with smaller sersic index ) , formed mainly from the disk material via central star formation .\\nhowever , the vertically thick boxy / peanut structures in barred galaxies ( often also called bulges ) @xcite are considered here as part of the bar .\\nsuch structures , and nuclear bars and rings are not included to the flux of the bulge in our decompositions . the galaxies and their decompositions are shown in figures 1 and 2 : ngc 524 is dominated by two almost circular lenses , whereas ngc 5365 has two oval - shaped components , both ovals with an embedded bar .\\nthe lenses in ngc 524 are directly visible in the image , and showing in the surface brightness profile as distinct exponential sub - sections . the best fit is obtained by @xmath11=2.8 sersic bulge and two flat ferrers functions ( ferrers index=1 ) for the lenses , implying a fairly small bulge - to - total flux ratio @xmath12=0.28 . for ngc 5365\\nthe inner bar / oval system is fitted by a single sersic function and the outer one with a single ferrers function , leading to a fairly exponential bulge ( @xmath11=2.0 ) and a small @xmath12=0.17 .\\ncounting all the flux above the exponential disk as a bulge , would lead to a considerable overestimate of the bulge flux ( @xmath12 @xmath13 0.5 in two component fits ) , in accordance with laurikainen et al .\\n( 2005 ) who showed that by omitting the bar / oval in the decomposition the @xmath12-flux ratio is overestimated , regardless of whether 1d or 2d - decompositions are used .\\nit is challenging to explain how this kind of multiple ovals / lenses form in s0 galaxies and how they are related to the evolution of bars . in section 6\\nthey will be discussed in the context of cosmologically motivated simulations by heller et al .\\nalthough bars in s0 galaxies are on average fairly prominent , weak bars are detected inside the ovals / lenses in eight of the galaxies : ngc 484 , ngc 507 , ngc 1161 , ngc 1351 , ngc 2768 , ngc 2902 , ngc 3998 and ngc 7377 .\\nall these galaxies are classified as non - barred ( de vaucouleurs et al .\\n1991 ; rc3 ) and no bar is directly visible in the @xmath14-band image .\\nhowever , a weak , genuine bar is visible in the residual image after subtracting the bulge model obtained from our decomposition ( see fig . 3 for ngc 3998 ) .\\ntaking into account that the evolution of bars and bulges might be coupled , it is interesting to look closer at the properties of the bulges of these galaxies .\\nwe find fairly small sersic indexes for the bulges in these nine galaxies ( @xmath15=2.5 ) , similar to the typical values recently found for s0 galaxies in decompositions where a multi - component approach is used ( laurikainen et al . 2005 , 2007 ; gadotti 2008 ) .\\nhowever , their average bulge - to - total flux ratio ( @xmath16 = 0.44 ) is higher than average for their hubble type , which for s0-s0/a galaxies @xmath13 0.25 - 0.28 ( laurikainen et al . 2005 , 2007 ; gadotti 2008 ) . in section 6 we will discuss that the weak bars , and probably also the massive , fairly exponential bulges in these galaxies , might be a manifestation of bar - induced secular evolution .\\nthe scale parameters of the bulge and the disk are sensitive to the evolutionary processes of galaxies during their cosmic history , and therefore offer an independent test of the importance of secular processes in s0s . a correlation between the scale parameters\\nis expected in models where the bulges were formed in slow secular processes ( reviewed by kormendy @xmath17 kennicutt 2004 ) , whereas no correlation is expected in models where the bulges were formed either in a fast dissipative collapse @xcite , or by mergers of large @xcite or small galaxies @xcite .\\nthe radial scale length of the disk , @xmath1 , and the absolute magnitude , @xmath18 , in the @xmath14-band are calculated in the following manner : 0.25 cm @xmath19 [ kpc ] = @xmath20 @xmath21 d[kpc ] / @xmath22 .    @xmath23 = @xmath24 - @xmath25 - @xmath26 - ( 5 @xmath21 log d[mpc ] ) - 25.0 ,    0.25 cm    where the internal dust correction for @xmath1 , @xmath22 = [ 1.02 - 0.13 @xmath21 log ( cos @xmath27 ) ] , is from @xcite . for @xmath18 ,\\nthe internal dust correction is @xmath26 = [ 0.11 + 0.79 @xmath21 ( 1-cos @xmath27)@xmath28 , taken from @xcite . for galaxy distance d we use @xmath29 = 75 km s@xmath30 mpc@xmath30 , and , galactic extinction , @xmath25 , is from @xcite . for the effective radius of the bulge , @xmath0 ,\\nno internal dust correction was made .\\nthe subscripts @xmath31 and @xmath32 refer to measured and intrinsic values , respectively .\\nwe find a clear correlation between @xmath0 and @xmath19 , with the coefficient of correlation of 0.66 , at the significance level of 7e-14 ( fig .\\nthe correlation is independent of the applied corrections .\\nthe correlation is found to be the same for bright ( @xmath18 @xmath33 -24.5 ) and faint ( @xmath18 @xmath34 -24.5 ) galaxies .\\nthis contradicts the recent result by @xcite who found an anti - correlation for bright s0s , and a positive correlation for faint s0s .\\nthis different result is most probably due to the deeper images and the more homogeneous database used in the present study .\\nnotice also that the scale parameters in barway et al . were derived using simple bulge - disk decompositions , whereas we use a multi - component approach .\\nthe correlation we find for s0s is similar to that found previously for spiral galaxies @xcite , and for 14 sb0 galaxies @xcite .\\nfinally , we compare the fractions of galaxies with bars and ovals / lenses in different hubble types\\n. if s0s were simply stripped spirals one would expect similar bar fractions in s0s and in their spiral progenitors . in table 1\\nwe use rc3 family classes for calculating bar fractions in different hubble type bins : for s0-s0/a galaxies the whole nirs0s sample of 184 galaxies is used , whereas for spirals we use the similarly sized ohio state university bright spiral galaxy sample ( osubsgs , eskridge et al .\\nwe find that s0s ( 46@xmath25 @xmath3 ) have bars ( sb+sab ) less frequently than s0/a galaxies ( 77@xmath29@xmath3 ) or spirals ( 61 - 70 @xmath3 ) .\\nthe values for spirals are in agreement with those found previously by other authors @xcite .\\nthe bar fractions for s0 and s0/a galaxies in the sub - sample of 127 nirs0s galaxies ( 38@xmath25 and 76@xmath210 @xmath3 , respectively ) are nearly the same as for the complete nirs0s sample . in table 1 the fractions of multiple bars are calculated in respect of the total number of barred galaxies , while all the other values are given in respect of the total number galaxies within the hubble type bin .\\nthe uncertainties are estimated from @xmath35 , where @xmath36 denotes the fraction in question in a sample of @xmath37 systems .\\nwe then use the @xmath38 , the maximum m=2 fourier density amplitude in the bar region , normalized to m=0 , to study three bar strength bins within each hubble type bin . for the osubsgs\\nwe use the values from laurikainen et al .\\n( 2004 ) , whereas for s0 and s0/a galaxies they were calculated in this study in a similar manner . as a lower limit for the barred galaxies we use @xmath38=0.1 .\\nwe confirm the above result that s0 galaxies have a smaller fraction of bars than s0/a galaxies or spirals .\\nwe find that : ( 1 ) sc - scd spirals have the largest number of weak bars ( @xmath38 = 0.1 - 0.3 ) and the smallest number of strong bars ( ( @xmath38 @xmath39 0.6 ) , and that the fraction of strong bars increases towards the s0/a galaxies .\\nthis is in agreement with the previous studies showing that the prominence of bars increases towards the early - type disk galaxies .\\n( 2 ) quite interestingly , although the fraction of strong bars increases from late - type spirals towards s0/a galaxies , it suddenly drops from 38@xmath29 @xmath3 to 10@xmath23 @xmath3 for s0s .\\nwe also find that ( 3 ) s0 galaxies have a larger fraction of ovals / lenses than s0/a galaxies galaxies ( 97@xmath22 v.s 82@xmath40 @xmath3 ) , and that ( 4 ) s0/a galaxies have a larger fraction of multiple bars than earlier or later type galaxies ( see laine et al .\\n2002 ; erwin @xmath17 sparke 2002 ) .\\nthe fraction of ovals / lenses is found to be the same for barred and for non - barred s0-s0/a galaxies ( 82@xmath41 @xmath3 v.s 86@xmath42 @xmath3 , respectively ) .\\nalthough ovals and lenses might have different light distributions , they are not distinct enough to be considered separately in our statistics .\\nin the current paradigm of galaxy formation , @xmath4cdm , the spheroidal components of galaxies were formed through mergers of disk galaxies : dry mergers are suggested to lead to the formation of elliptical galaxies , whereas mergers of gas poor with gas rich galaxies lead to the formation of bulges in the disk - dominated galaxies ( khockfar @xmath17 burkert 2003 ; naab et al .\\nminor mergers are actually more common in the universe and they are suggested to form even 55 @xmath3 of the spheroid stars from accreted satellites ( abadi et al .\\n2003 ) . in @xmath4cdm\\nthe disks form after a major merger when hot gas in the halo settles into the disk ( kauffmann et al .\\n1999 ; springer @xmath17 hernquist 2005 ) . in this picture\\nevery dark matter halo is expected to possess a substantial pressure supported classical bulge with elliptical - like photometric properties ( steinmetz @xmath17 navarro 2002 ) .\\nalthough many observations support this scenario it is also faced with severe problems , for example the bulges , not only in spiral galaxies , but even in s0-galaxies are fairly disk - like and have smaller bulge - to - total mass flux ratios than predicted by cosmological models .\\n_ our finding that the scale parameters of the bulge ( @xmath0 ) and the disk ( @xmath1 ) are well correlated _ for s0s , provides an additional problem for @xmath4cdm : such a correlation is difficult to explain if the formation of bulges and disks in s0 galaxies were decoupled .\\nalternatively , s0s might be descendants of spirals whose star formation has faded after consuming the gas or losing it by some stripping mechanism , like ram pressure stripping @xcite , halo stripping @xcite , or galaxy harrasment @xcite .\\nrecent evidence supporting this idea comes from the tully - fisher ( tf ) relation and from the analysis of the properties of globular clusters in galaxies .\\ns0s lie below the spiral galaxies in the tf relation , having lower luminosities @xcite .\\nthis deviation is explained by luminosity evolution of spiral galaxies : the transformation from spirals to s0s occurred at various times in the past , and the galaxies have been passively fading ever since . the globular cluster frequency ( the number of globular clusters per unit @xmath43-band luminosity ) has been used as an independent estimate of the degree to which the luminosity of s0s has faded relative to that of its spiral progenitor @xcite .\\nthis estimate is based on the assumption that the frequency of globular clusters is constant during the transformation process .\\nthe fact that the bulges in s0-galaxies also have many characteristics of disk - like structures , including their kinematic properties ( cappellari et al .\\n2007 ) , is consistent with this picture .\\nhowever , if s0s were simply passively formed from s0/a spirals it would be difficult to explain our finding that _ the fraction of bars is considerably lower in s0s than in s0/a galaxies , which are expected to be their progenitors in the hubble sequence . _ bars should be fairly robust structures , evidenced by the fact that the bar fraction , at least in massive luminous spirals , is maintained nearly constant between the redshift range @xmath44= 0 - 0.84 @xcite .\\nalthough the hypothesis of s0s as stripped spirals is a promising idea , an important piece of information is still missing in this picture .\\nindeed , bars are expected to be efficient drivers of galaxy evolution : the angular momentum transfer between gas and stars leads to gas infall and subsequent star formation in the central regions , which can add to the mass of the bulge @xcite . if the angular momentum transfer occurs between the bar and the halo , that leads to the evolution of the bar @xcite : a bar first grows in mass and length , but if the bulge mass at the same time increases due to the gas infall , that might lead to a subsequent weakening of the bar .\\nweakening of the bar is most efficient in strong bars with flat - top surface density profiles @xcite , typical for early - type disk galaxies ( elmegreen @xmath17 elmegreen 1985 ) . in this study\\nwe have shown indirect observational evidence of such evolution : _ it is tempting to think that bar weakening due to increased central mass concentration is the explanation for the lower fraction of bars and the larger fraction of ovals / lenses in s0s .\\n_ we also find that s0s galaxies have a deficiency particularly of the strongest bars which fits to this picture .\\n_ a manifestation of bar - induced secular evolution of galaxies is probably also our finding that nine galaxies in our sample have massive disk - like bulges ( @xmath16=0.44 , @xmath15=2.5 ) , surrounded by weak bars and lenses_. in principle , an increase in bulge mass in these galaxies could have occurred in a similar manner as discussed above .\\nalso , once the bulge mass had increased , the bar might have started to weaken , leaving only a weak bar inside a lens .\\nthe lenses surrounding the weak bars can be naturally explained as relics of the evolution of the bar : many barred galaxies have lenses of the same dimension as the bar , aligned with the bar major axis .\\na problem in this scenario is that normal spiral galaxies do nt have enough gas for making such massive bulges by star formation ( kormendy @xmath17 kennicutt 2004 ) , not at least without a significant accretion of extragalactic gas to the disk .\\nit is still possible , however , that these galaxies are associated with the formation and evolution of bars at higher redshifts .\\nthe role of bars in cosmological simulations has not yet been studied much , but one such attempt has been made by @xcite .\\ntheir simulations , starting from initial values motivated by cosmological simulations , include star formation , cooling and feedback . in these simulations disk - like bulges form at early phases of galaxy evolution during the gas - rich epoch in the history of galaxies , being thus capable of accounting for the large bulge - to - total flux ratios of the disky bulges found in some of the s0s .\\nthe triaxial halos are the driving force to the formation of primordial bars , which trigger nuclear bars . after 4 - 5 gyr\\nthe primary bars are weakened to fat ovals and the nuclear bars are decoupled .\\nthese processes might be a key for understanding the multiple bar / oval / lens structures seen in many s0 galaxies .\\nacknowledgements : e. laurikainen and h. salo acknowledge the academy of finland for support , and r. buta acknowledge the support of nsf grant ast-0507140 .\\nabadi , m. , navarro , j. , steinmetz , m. , & eke , v. 2003 , , 597 , 21 aguerri , j. , elias -

commutator as well as the commutator of the lie algebra generators . the algebra still closes for hermitian matrices , but it is for instance not possible to impose the trace to be zero .\\nthis observation can be interpreted in two ways : + ( a ) the choice of gauge group is restricted to @xmath41 in the fundamental , anti - fundamental or adjoint representation ; or + ( b ) the gauge fields are valued in the enveloping algebra of a lie algebra and then any ( unitary ) representation is possible .\\n+ the case ( a ) applies also to the @xmath42 case and imposes severe restrictions on the allowed charges ; it has been studied carefully and has led to `` theorems ''  @xcite .\\nthe second case avoids the restrictions on the gauge group and choice of representation , but needs to address the potential problem of too many degrees of freedom , since all coefficient functions of the monomials in the generators could a priori be physical fields .\\nthe solution to this problem is that the coefficient fields are not all independent .\\nthey are rather functions of the correct number of ordinary gauge fields via seiberg - witten maps and their generalizations .\\nthe situation is reminiscent of the construction of superfields and supersymmetric actions in terms of ordinary fields in supersymmetry .\\nthis method , referred as seiberg -

theoretical frameworks involving the full @xmath0-resummation .\\nour numerical estimates of the contribution to the processes coming from the photon exchange , pins impeccably down a lower bound on @xmath3 to be as high as around up to @xmath178 gev , depending on the cosmogenic @xmath16-flux .\\nfor above analysis it was necessary to use results of @xcite which shows explicitly that the `` no - go theorem ''\\n@xcite is certainly not applicable to our sw - map based @xmath0-exact models of the ncgft .\\nnamely , it is known to be impossible in noncommutative geometry to directly form tensor products from the nc fields as long as there is no additional underlaying mathematical structure .\\nthe sw - map based models do however have an additional underlying mathematical structure : they can be understood as the deformation quantization of ordinary fiber bundles over a poisson manifold . with this additional structure ,\\ntensor products are possible and survive the quantization procedure  @xcite . however , the authors in @xcite failed to directly form tensor products of noncommutative fields .\\nthe proof of this failure is given in @xcite .\\nnow we first discuss @xmath0-exact computation of the one - loop quantum correction to the @xmath16-propagator .\\nwe in particular evaluate the neutrino two - point function , and demonstrate how quantum effects in the @xmath0-exact sw map approach to ncgft s , together with a combination of schwinger , feynman , and hqet parameterization , reveal a much richer structure yielding the one - loop quantum correction in a closed form .\\ngeneral expression for the neutrino self - energy ( [ sigma1ab ] ) contains in ( [ a1 ] ) both a hard @xmath96 uv term and the uv / ir mixing term with a logarithmic infrared singularity @xmath179 .\\nresults shows complete decoupling of the uv divergent term from softened uv / ir mixing term and from the finite terms as well .\\nour deformed dispersion relations at both the low and high energies and at the leading order do not depend on the noncommutative scale @xmath3 .\\nthe low energy dispersion relation is , in principle , capable of generating a direction dependent superluminal velocity , this can be seen clearly from the maximal attainable velocity of the neutrinos @xmath180 where @xmath163 is the angle with respect to the direction perpendicular to the nc plane .\\nthis gives one more example how such spontaneous @xmath0-background breaking of lorentz symmetry could affect the particle kinematics through quantum corrections , even without divergent behavior like uv / ir mixing .\\non the other hand one can also see that the magnitude of superluminosity is in general very large in our model as a quantum effect , thus seems contradicting various observations which suggests much smaller values @xcite . on the other hand , note\\nthat the large superluminal velocity issue may also be reduced / removed by taking into account several considerations and/or properties : + ( 1 . )\\nselection of a constant nonzero @xmath0 background in this paper is due to the computational simplicity .\\nthe results will , however , still hold for a nc background that is varying sufficiently slowly with respect to the scale of noncommutativity .\\nthere is no physics reason to expect @xmath0 to be a globally constant background _\\nether_. in fact , if the @xmath0 background is only nonzero in tiny regions ( nc bubbles ) the effects of the modified dispersion relation will be suppressed macroscopically .\\ncertainly a better understanding of possible sources of nc is needed .\\nwe have considered only the purely noncommutative neutrino - photon coupling .\\nhowever , it has been pointed out that modified neutrino dispersion relation could open decay channels within the commutative standard model framework @xcite . in our case\\nthis would further provide decay channel(s ) which can bring superluminal neutrinos to normal ones .\\nnote that the model 1 is not the only allowed deformed model with noncommutative neutrino - photon coupling . and\\nas we have shown for our model 2 , there could be no modified dispersion relation(s ) for deformation(s ) other than 1 , therefore it is reasonable to conjecture that seiberg - witten map freedom may also serve as one possible remedy to this issue .\\nour results differs with respect to @xcite since in our case both terms are proportional to the spacetime noncommutativity dependent @xmath0-ratio ( the scale - independent structure ! ) factor in ( [ degen1 ] ) , which arise from the natural non - locality of our actions . besides the divergent terms\\n, a new spinor structure @xmath181 with finite coefficients emerges in our computation , see ( [ sigma1ab])-([a2 ] ) .\\nall these structures are proportional to @xmath134 , therefore if appropriate renormalization conditions are imposed , the commutative dispersion relation @xmath117 can still hold , as a part of the full set of solutions obtained in ( 23 ) . + ( 5 . ) finally , we mention that our approach to uv / ir mixing should not be confused with the one based on a theory with uv completion ( @xmath182 ) , where a theory becomes an effective qft , and the uv / ir mixing manifests itself via a specific relationship between the uv and the ir cutoffs @xcite .    from the same actions ( [ sgauge ] , [ sfermion ] ) , but for three different cosmological laboratories , that is from uhe cosmic ray neutrino scatterings on nuclei @xcite , from the bbn and from the rpai @xcite , we obtain very similar , a quite strong bounds on the nc scale , of the order of @xmath183 gev . note in particular that all results depicted in figs.[fig : ncsm - crosssections]-[fig : lambdavst ] , and [ fig : z2nubarnunc ] show closed - convergent forms .\\nall above summarized properties are previously unknown features of @xmath0-exact nc gauge field theory .\\nthey appear in the model with the action presented in section  4 . the alternative action , and the corresponding @xmath16-self - energy ( [ a9 ] ) , has less striking features , but it does have it s own advantages due to the absence of a hard uv divergences , and the absence of complicated finite terms .\\nthe structure in ( [ a9 ] ) is different ( it is _ nc - scale / energy _ dependent ) with respect to the nc scale - independent structure from ( [ degen1 ] ) , as well as to the structure arising from fermion self - energy computation in the case of @xmath9-product only unexpanded theories @xcite .\\nhowever , ( [ a9 ] ) does posses powerful uv / ir mixing effect .\\nthis is fortunate with regard to the use of low -

      " b'the interplay of disorder and coulomb repulsion between electrons raises many fundamental questions not only in solid state physics@xcite but also in the physics of cold atoms.@xcite electron repulsion can lead to a mott insulator,@xcite a description of which must invoke many - body physics . on the other hand , presence of disorder in a system of non - interacting electrons can cause anderson localization.@xcite the simultaneous presence of disorder and electronic interaction is known to give rise to new , subtle many - body phenomena.@xcite an important question in the physics of interacting and disordered electrons is the stability of magnetic order .\\nthe effect of disorder has on magnetic long - range order has been explored by various analytical @xcite and numerical methods.@xcite a microscopic lattice model to study these effects is the anderson - hubbard model , which has been explored using quantum monte carlo ( qmc),@xcite dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft ) @xcite and hartree - fock calculations.@xcite one of the questions that have received particular attention is whether the long - range antiferromagnetic order ( aflro ) , that occurs at half - filling in the clean limit , is stable when disorder is present .\\nincreasing disorder has generically been found to be detrimental for aflro.@xcite    magnetic instabilities and the formation of local moments have also been investigated in high mobility semiconductor heterostructures.@xcite some experiments have found the ferromagnetic ( uniform ) susceptibility to behave critically near the mit,@xcite while other experiments only found a strong enhancement.@xcite    analytical work has predicted critical behavior of the ferromagnetic susceptibility as the metal - insulator transition is approached from either side of the transition , and the physics has been attributed to either the formation of local moments @xcite or to the vanishing of the spin diffusion constant either at or near the ( charge)transport critical point.@xcite    qmc investigations in two dimensions have also suggested the existence of a quantum critical point ( qcp ) between a metallic and an ( anderson)insulating phase when the disorder strength is varied.@xcite magnetic properties both near and away from the qcp have received less attention .\\n_ @xcite found an increase in the ferromagnetic susceptibility both sides of the metal - insulator transition and this behaviour was attributed to the formation of local moments.@xcite    in this paper , we report results on the magnetic properties of the anderson - hubbard model in two dimensions obtained through extensive qmc simulations .\\nwe concentrate on the ferromagnetic ( fm ) and the antiferromagnetic ( af ) susceptibilities .\\nthere are two main results : ( i ) we find that , at sufficiently low temperatures , an increase in the disorder increases the fm susceptibility , and ( ii ) the enhancement of the fm susceptibility is related neither to the mit , nor can it be explained by the formation of local moments . in contrast , increasing disorder always reduces the af susceptibility .\\nour investigation of interacting electrons in the presence of disorder is based on the anderson - hubbard hamiltonian on a square lattice @xmath1 here @xmath2 is the single - electron part where @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) are fermion creation ( annihilation ) operators for site @xmath5 and spin @xmath6 , @xmath7 is the operator for the local density , @xmath8 denotes the chemical potential , and @xmath9 is the hopping amplitude for electrons between nearest neighbor sites .\\nthe local energies @xmath10 are random variables which are sampled uniformly from the interval @xmath11 $ ] ; hence the width @xmath12 characterizes the strength of the disorder .\\nthe interaction is taken to be repulsive ( @xmath13 ) .\\nthe model is solved numerically using determinantal qmc ( dqmc).@xcite the hopping integral @xmath9 sets the unit of energy ( we set @xmath14=@xmath15=1 ) and the simulation now contains three independent energy - scales : the disorder strength @xmath12 , the interaction strength @xmath16 , and the temperature @xmath17 .\\nthe average filling @xmath18 is tuned by the chemical potential @xmath8 .    to extract the magnetic behaviour\\n, we focus on on the real - space equal - time spin - spin correlation function,@xcite defined as @xmath19 where @xmath20 .\\n@xmath21 measures the extent to which the z - component of a spin on site @xmath22 is correlated to the z - component of another spin at a distance @xmath23 .\\nalthough we have used the operator @xmath24 in eq .\\n[ definition_realspace ] to define @xmath21 , we explicitly confirmed that our calculations have the full su(2 ) invariance of the problem .    from @xmath21\\n, we define the spin structure factor @xmath25 as the fourier transform : @xmath26 the @xmath27-dependent susceptibility is obtained from @xmath28.@xcite the wave - vectors @xmath29 yield the fm susceptibility @xmath30 , and @xmath31 yield the af susceptibility @xmath32 , respectively .\\nthe lattice spacing @xmath33 is assumed to be unity .\\nall plots shown are for a @xmath34 square lattice .\\nwe have confirmed that the conclusions are unchanged for computations on @xmath35 and @xmath36 square lattices by explicit simulations .\\nthere are two sources of statistical error in this analysis : one is due to the qmc simulations , the other arises from disorder averaging . for all parameter sets studied here ,\\nthe intrinsic qmc error for any given disorder realization is much smaller than the error arising from different disorder realizations .\\nwe start with the non - interacting system . in figs .\\n[ u0_af_uniform](a ) and ( b ) we show the dependence of the inverse af and inverse fm susceptibilities , respectively , on @xmath17 for @xmath37 and various disorder strengths . without interaction ,\\nan increase in disorder always reduces both the af and fm susceptibilities .\\nnamely , increasing disorder creates more fluctuations in the site - energy landscape and , since @xmath37 , two electrons of opposite spins will tend to occupy the lowest energy sites , thereby reducing the effective local moment and destroying magnetism .\\nthe inset plots the square of the local moment as a function of temperature , defined as @xmath38 .\\nc +    now we include the interaction @xmath16 . in fig .\\n[ inv_afchi_two_param_sets ] , we plot the inverse af susceptibility for two different @xmath39 parameter sets . in all cases , @xmath40 decreases linearly with decreasing @xmath17 .\\nit is clearly seen that the plot for every value of @xmath12 can be extrapolated to zero at @xmath41 , which signifies that there will be no af ordering .\\nthis behaviour is expected for the anderson - hubbard model far away from half - filling ( @xmath42 ) .\\nfurthermore , the af susceptibility decreases monotonically as the disorder strength is increased .\\nc +    this is not surprising since aflro will be hindered by randomness .\\nnamely , electrons inevitably find it difficult to hop ( and thus gain kinetic energy ) when the energies on two neighbouring sites are very different .\\nferromagnetism , on the other hand , stems from the need to avoid strong coulomb repulsion locally . in fig .\\n[ inv_ferrochi_two_param_sets ] , we plot @xmath43 _\\n@xmath17 for the same two parameter sets as in fig .\\n[ inv_afchi_two_param_sets ] . at high temperatures\\n@xmath30 decreases with increasing disorder strength .\\nhowever , at low temperatures , the opposite behaviour is seen to occur .\\nwe point out the difference between fig .\\n[ inv_ferrochi_two_param_sets ] and the non - interacting case in fig.[u0_af_uniform](b ) .\\nthus it is clear that the enhancement of @xmath30 with increasing disorder at low temperatures takes place only in the simultaneous presence of interaction and disorder .\\nalso , this behaviour is ubiquitous in all parameter sets we have investigated . even at weak coupling ( e.g. @xmath44 )\\n, the ferromagnetic susceptibility rises with increasing disorder at lower temperatures .\\nc +    to investigate if the enhancement of the ferromagnetic susceptibility is related to the metal - insulator transition ( mit ) in @xmath0 , we plot @xmath30 in fig .  [ ferrochi_vs_d ] against the disorder strength for @xmath45 , @xmath46 . for these parameters , the @xmath0 anderson - hubbard model shows a metal-(anderson ) insulator quantum phase transition at @xmath47.@xcite it is clear from fig .\\n[ ferrochi_vs_d ] that @xmath30 does not show any enhancement close to the mit .\\nthis holds for all parameter sets we have investigated .    in fig .\\n[ musq ] we plot the average squared moment _ vs_. temperature for different values of the disorder strength for @xmath45 , @xmath46 .\\nas the disorder strength is increased , the magnetic moment is seen to decrease at all temperatures .\\nthus the enhancement of the ferromagnetic susceptibility at low temperatures can not be explained by an increase in the number of magnetic moments with disorder .\\nwe also emphasize that the low temperature increase in @xmath30 is different from the stoner criterion for ferromagnetism , @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the electron density of states at the fermi level .\\nsince increasing disorder ( at fixed @xmath16 ) inevitably leads to loss of spectral density at the fermi level , the stoner criterion predicts that ferromagnetic tendencies are acted against by increasing disorder .    in fig .\\n[ kappa ] , we plot the charge susceptibility @xmath50 _\\nvs_. @xmath17 for different disorder strengths for @xmath45 , @xmath46 .\\nthe charge susceptibility decreases monotonically with increasing disorder strength for all temperatures investigated .\\nsince the charge susceptibility is expected to be proportional to the density of states at the fermi level ( at fixed interaction strength and electron density ) , we infer that @xmath49 is decreasing with disorder .\\nthe charge susceptibility does not show any discernible change in behaviour with disorder at high or low temperatures , as in the case of the dc conductivity @xmath51 @xcite but in contrast with @xmath30 and @xmath52 , thus implying that at low temperatures the charge and spin sectors display different behaviour in the simultaneous presence of disorder and interaction .\\nin conclusion , our results show that in a strongly correlated system at low enough temperatures , an increase in randomness can increase the tendency towards ferromagnetism .\\nthis tendency towards ferromagnetism is present for all interaction strengths we have investigated , although , as expected , stronger interaction increases the ferromagnetic susceptibility .\\nwe have shown that this enhancement in ferromagnetic suscpetibility is not due to ( i ) the formation of local moments and ( ii ) the stoner instability .\\nit is a ubiquitous low - temperature phenomenon in the simultaneous presence of disorder and interaction . in particular , this is not related to the phase transition between the metallic and anderson - insulating phase .\\nrather , the enhancement is seen in both the metallic and insulating phases .\\nwe have also established that at low temperatures , the response of the spin sector to an increase in the disorder strength is markedly different to that of the charge sector .\\nsimilar effects are also seen in calculations using dmft.@xcite therefore anderson localization can not explain these effects since it is absent in @xmath53 where dmft is exact .\\nthe details of the dmft calculations will be addressed in a future publication .\\nthis work was supported in part by the deutsche forschungsgemeinschaft through the trr 80 .\\none of us ( kb ) acknowledges support by the foundation for polish science ( fnp ) through team/2010 - 6/2 project co - financed by the eu european regional development fund .\\nwe are grateful to a. p. kampf for helpful discussions and to m. sekania for help with the computer cluster at the university of augsburg .\\nd.  belitz and t.  r.  kirkpatrick , phys .\\nlett . , * 63 * , 1296 ( 1989 ) ; t.  r.  kirkpatrick and d.  belitz , phys .\\nb. , * 41 * , 11082 ( 1990 ) ; d.  belitz and t.  r.  kirkpatrick , phys .\\nb. , * 44 * , 955 ( 1991 ) ;                  a. a. shashkin , s.v .\\nkravchenko , v. t. dolgopolov , and t. m. klapwijk , phys .\\nlett . * 87 * , 086801 ( 2001 ) ; a. a. shashkin , s. anissimova , m. r. sakr , s.v .\\nkravchenko , v. t. dolgopolov , and t. m. klapwijk , phys .\\n* 96 * , 036403 ( 2006 ) .']\n",

today  @xcite \\n while there is little room left to doubt the existence of dm , its microscopic properties are virtually unknown . \\n one of the few properties in which we can be confident is that dm should be stable on time scales greater than the age of the universe , suggesting the existence of a new `` dark '' symmetry . \\n but precisely what symmetry stabilizes dm is a mystery .    \\n many models employ a discrete @xmath2 symmetry to stabilize dm . \\n this @xmath2 symmetry is often motivated by the need to suppress dangerous operators in new physics scenarios that solve the

component nature of dm can potentially be tested at future ton - scale experiments .    \\n while we have focused on the phenomenology relevant for direct detection experiments , the @xmath1 model also has implications for high energy colliders and indirect detection probes . at colliders , the most important consequence of the @xmath1 model , like other models in which dm couples to the sm through the higgs portal , is to cause the higgs boson to decay invisibly if kinematically allowed . \\n an invisibly decaying higgs boson can be discovered using the vector boson fusion and @xmath251 production channels at the lhc ( @xmath252 tev ) with 30 fb@xmath253 of data  @xcite . \\n another generic dm collider probe is a monojet produced in association with pairs of dark matter particles  @xcite . in scalar singlet dm models , this occurs via gluon fusion accompanied by emission of a jet . \\n while the tevatron is not sensitive to the monojet signature in this class of dm models , the lhc could potentially probe regions with large higgs portal couplings @xmath254  @xcite . \\n we also note that a more complete study of the monojet signature in higgs portal dm models going beyond the effective field theory approach is warranted given that a relatively light higgs and a top quark loop enter into the amplitude .    \\n a potential indirect probe of the @xmath1 model is to observe gamma rays from annihilating @xmath28 or @xmath29 particles . \\n in particular , fermi - lat data on the isotropic gamma - ray diffuse emission  @xcite , depending on various astrophysical assumptions , can constrain low mass @xmath255 gev dm particles annihilating through the higgs portal  @xcite . for such constraints to be relevant \\n , the lightest component should carry most of the cosmic dm abundance , since the gamma - ray flux scales as the square of the dm density . \\n in particular , light dm particles with very large higgs portal couplings will be depleted efficiently and therefore not subject to such constraints . \\n another possibility is to observe monochromatic gamma - ray lines via @xmath256 . \\n this has been studied in ref .  \\n @xcite , and fermi - lat data allows one to probe the model deep within the resonance region @xmath257 .    \\n there are many directions for future investigations with dm and non -

abelian finite groups , and ultimately non - abelian discrete gauge symmetries as the origin of dm stability . finally , given that non - abelian discrete symmetries may underlie the patterns observed in the quark and lepton masses and mixings , it is interesting to speculate that dm stability may intimately be connected to flavor symmetries .    \\n stability on cosmological time scales constitutes one of the few and robust guiding principles in formulation of a theory of dark matter . \\n alternatives to the canonical @xmath2 parity symmetry may lead to new phenomena associated with dark matter , as has been clearly demonstrated by our study of the minimal model of @xmath1 dark matter . \\n we anticipate that new data from a variety of experimental and observational fronts will soon bring us closer in unraveling the particle nature of dark matter and the symmetry which protects its lifetime .      \\n we thank francesco deramo , andreas hohenegger , chris jillings , alexander kartavtsev , rafael lang , maxim pospelov , and jesse thaler for helpful discussions and correspondence . \\n research at the perimeter institute is supported in part by the government of canada through nserc and by the province of ontario through medt . \\n research at max -

',\n       b' this article reviews the application of the non - equilibrium green s function formalism to the simulation of novel photovoltaic devices utilizing quantum confinement effects in low dimensional absorber structures . \\n it covers well - known aspects of the fundamental negf theory for a system of interacting electrons , photons and phonons with relevance for the simulation of optoelectronic devices and introduces at the same time new approaches to the theoretical description of the elementary processes of photovoltaic device operation , such as photogeneration via coherent excitonic absorption , phonon - mediated indirect optical transitions or non - radiative recombination via defect states . \\n while the description of the theoretical framework is kept as general as possible , two specific prototypical quantum photovoltaic devices , a single quantum well photodiode and a silicon - oxide based superlattice absorber , are used to illustrated the kind of unique insight that numerical simulations based on the theory are able to provide . ',\n       b' analyses of spectra obtained with the _ far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer ( fuse ) _ satellite , together with spectra from the _ copernicus _ and _ imaps _ instruments , reveal an unexplained very wide range in the observed deuterium / hydrogen ( d / h ) ratios for interstellar gas in the galactic disk beyond the local bubble . \\n we argue that spatial variations in the depletion of deuterium onto dust grains can explain these local variations in the observed gas - phase d / h ratios . \\n we present a variable deuterium depletion model that naturally explains the constant measured values of d / h inside the local bubble , the wide range of gas - phase d / h ratios observed in the intermediate regime ( @xmath0 19.220.7 ) , and the low gas - phase d / h ratios observed at larger hydrogen column densities . \\n we consider empirical tests of the deuterium depletion hypothesis : ( i ) correlations of gas - phase d / h ratios with depletions of the refractory metals iron and silicon , and ( ii ) correlation with the h@xmath1 rotational temperature . \\n both of these tests are consistent with deuterium depletion from the gas phase in cold , not recently shocked , regions of the ism , and high gas - phase d / h ratios in gas that has been shocked or otherwise heated recently . \\n we argue that the most representative value for the total ( gas plus dust ) d / h ratio within 1 kpc of the sun is @xmath2 ( 1  @xmath3 ) parts per million ( ppm ) . \\n this ratio constrains galactic chemical evolution models to have a very small deuterium astration factor , the ratio of primordial to total ( d / h ) ratio in the local region of the galactic disk , which we estimate to be @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) or @xmath6 ( @xmath5 ) depending on the adopted light element nuclear reaction rates . ',\n       b' the excursion set approach allows one to estimate the abundance and spatial distribution of virialized dark matter haloes efficiently and accurately . \\n the predictions of this approach depend on how the nonlinear processes of collapse and virialization are modelled . \\n we present simple analytic approximations which allow us to compare the excursion set predictions associated with spherical and ellipsoidal collapse . \\n in particular , we present formulae for the universal unconditional mass function of bound objects and the conditional mass function which describes the mass function of the progenitors of haloes in a given mass range today . \\n we show that the ellipsoidal collapse based moving barrier model provides a better description of what we measure in the numerical simulations than the spherical collapse based constant barrier model , although the agreement between model and simulations is better at large lookback times . \\n our results for the conditional mass function can be used to compute accurate approximations to the local - density mass function which quantifies the tendency for massive haloes to populate denser regions than less massive haloes . \\n this happens because low - density regions can be thought of as being collapsed haloes viewed at large lookback times , whereas high - density regions are collapsed haloes viewed at small lookback times . \\n although we have only applied our analytic formulae to two simple barrier shapes , we show that they are , in fact , accurate for a wide variety of moving barriers . \\n we suggest how they can be used to study the case in which the initial dark matter distribution is not completely cold .    \\n galaxies : clustering  cosmology : theory  dark matter . ',\n       b\" the prompt @xmath0 burst from a core - collapse supernova ( sn ) is subject to both matter - induced flavor conversions and strong neutrino - neutrino refractive effects . for the lowest - mass progenitors , leading to o - ne - mg core sne \\n , the matter density profile can be so steep that the usual msw matter effects occur within the dense - neutrino region close to the neutrino sphere . in this case \\n a `` split '' occurs in the emerging spectrum , i.e. , the @xmath0 flavor survival probability shows a step - like feature . \\n we explain this feature analytically as a `` msw prepared spectral split . '' in a three - flavor treatment , the step - like feature actually consists of two narrowly spaced splits . \\n they are determined by two combinations of flavor - lepton numbers that are conserved under collective oscillations . \",\n       b' quantum state teleportation of optical number states is conspicuously absent from the list of experimental milestones achieved to date  @xcite . \\n here we demonstrate analytically a teleportation scheme with fidelity @xmath0 for optical number states of arbitrary dimension using linear optical elements only . to this end \\n , we develop an epr source to supply bell - type states for the teleportation , and show how the same set - up can also be used as a bell - state analyser ( bsa ) when implemented in a time - reversal manner . \\n these two aspects are then brought together to complete the teleportation protocol in a scheme that can deliver perfect fidelity , albeit with an efficiency that decays exponentially as the occupation of the number states increases stepwise . \\n the epr source and bsa schemes both consist of two optical axes in a symmetrical v - shape experimental layout , along which beam - splitters are placed cross - beam fashion at regular intervals , with their transmittivities treated as variables for which the values are calculated _ ad hoc_. in particular , we show the full treatment for the case of qutrit teleportation , and calculate the transmittivity values of the beam splitters required for teleporting qubits , qutrits , qupentits , quheptits and qunits . the general case for arbitrary - dimensional number state teleportation \\n is demonstrated through a counting argument .    \\n photons ( interchangeably referred to as optical number - states or fock - states ) are bosons . \\n unlike fermionic electrons , they have the property that they can fly undisturbed since they do not interact with each other . \\n this can be used to great advantage particularly in areas such as quantum communication and information processing where an ideal transmission medium would have the property that it could carry information without degrading it , i.e. that the received information would have a perfect fidelity of @xmath1 . in this respect , \\n photons represent the medium of choice and offer significant advantages over electronic channels . \\n but since they do not interact , they are also difficult to control ( compared to electrons ) . \\n +   + this paper offers a generalisation of the teleportation protocol to an arbitrary dimension of optical number states . \\n its generality sets it apart from previous teleportation schemes . \\n the first laboratory implementations of teleportation , performed by bouwmeester et al .  \\n @xcite and boschi et al .  \\n @xcite , succeeded in teleporting a photon s polarisation state , that is , an internal degree of freedom . \\n a more general scheme was implemented by furusawa et al .  \\n @xcite , where a coherent state of light was teleported via continuous variables  @xcite , that is , a subset of the spatial degree of freedom . \\n a third and more general type of teleportation was realised for a single optical number state in superposition with the vacuum state  @xcite . \\n we take this as our starting point , and extend the idea of number state teleportation to arbitrarily large states . ',\n       b' we theoretically investigate the creation of squeezed states of a bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) trapped in a magnetic double well potential . the number or phase squeezed states are created by modulating the tunnel coupling between the two wells periodically with twice the josephson frequency , i.e. , through parametric amplification . \\n simulations are performed with the multi configurational hartree method for bosons ( mctdhb ) . \\n we employ optimal control theory to bring the condensate to a complete halt at a final time , thus creating a highly squeezed state ( squeezing factor of 0.12 , @xmath0 db ) suitable for atom interferometry . ',\n       b' we show that a star orbiting close enough to an adiabatically grown supermassive black hole can capture a large number of weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) during its lifetime . \\n wimp annihilation energy release in low- to medium - mass stars is comparable with or even exceeds the luminosity of such stars due to thermonuclear burning . \\n the excessive energy release in the stellar core may result in an evolution scenario different from what is expected for a regular star . \\n the model thus predicts the existence of unusual stars within the central parsec of galactic nuclei . \\n if found , such stars would provide evidence for the existence of particle dark matter . \\n white dwarfs seem to be the most promising candidates to look for . \\n the signature of a white dwarf burning wimps would be a very hot star with mass and radius characteristic for a white dwarf , but with luminosity exceeding the typical luminosity of a white dwarf by orders of magnitude @xmath0@xmath1 . \\n a white dwarf with a highly eccentric orbit around the central black hole may exhibit variations in brightness correlated with the orbital phase . ',\n       b' the existence of large - scale dynamos in rigidly rotating turbulent convection without shear is studied using three - dimensional numerical simulations of penetrative rotating compressible convection . \\n we demonstrate that rotating convection in a cartesian domain can drive a large - scale dynamo even in the absence of shear . \\n the large - scale field contains a significant fraction of the total field in the saturated state . \\n the simulation results are compared with one - dimensional mean - field dynamo models where turbulent transport coefficients , as determined using the test field method , are used . \\n the reason for the absence of large - scale dynamo action in earlier studies is shown to be due to the rotation being too slow : whereas the @xmath0-effect can change sign , its magnitude stays approximately constant as a function of rotation , and the turbulent diffusivity decreases monotonically with increasing rotation . \\n only when rotation is rapid enough a large - scale dynamo can be excited . \\n the one - dimensional mean - field model with dynamo coefficients from the test field results predicts reasonably well the dynamo excitation in the direct simulations . \\n this result further validates the test field procedure and reinforces the interpretation that the observed dynamo is driven by a turbulent @xmath0-effect . \\n this result demonstrates the existence of an @xmath0-effect and an @xmath1-dynamo with natural forcing . ',\n       b' the theory of highly super - eddington black hole accretion , @xmath0 , was developed in the 1980s in warsaw by paczyski and his collaborators @xcite@xcite in terms of _ polish doughnuts_@xmath1 , i.e. low viscosity , rotating accretion flows that are optically thick , radiation pressure supported , cooled by advection , and radiatively very inefficient . \\n polish doughnuts resemble fat tori with two narrow funnels along rotation axis . the funnels collimate radiation into beams with highly super - eddington luminosities . _ slim disks _ introduced later by abramowicz , lasota and collaborators first in @xcite , and more fully in @xcite have only moderately super - eddington accretion rates , @xmath2 , rather disk - like shapes , and almost thermal spectra @xcite-@xcite . ',\n       b' the fully self - consistent random phase approximation ( rpa ) is constructed within the unitary correlation operator method ( ucom ) , which describes the dominant interaction - induced short - range central and tensor correlations by a unitary transformation . \\n based on the correlated argonne v18 interaction , the rpa is employed in studies of multipole response in closed - shell nuclei across the nuclide chart . \\n the ucom - rpa results in a collective character of giant resonances , and it describes rather well the properties of isoscalar giant monopole resonances . \\n however , the excitation energies of isovector giant dipole resonances and isoscalar giant quadrupole resonances are overestimated due to the missing long - range correlations and three - body contributions . ',\n       b' it has been thought for many years that the milky way is an overly large spiral galaxy . \\n using cephied distances to 17 spiral galaxies we calculate the true linear diameters of those galaxies . \\n these diameters are then compared to that of the milky way which is found to be , at most , an averagely sized spiral galaxy . when compared to galaxies of approximately the same hubble type ( @xmath0 ) the milky way is found to be slightly undersized . \\n this suggests that the hubble parameter is at the lower end of the currently accepted range of possibilities . ',\n       b' we demonstrate current - induced bipolar switching in in - plane magnetized spin - valve devices that incorporate a perpendicularly magnetized spin polarizing layer . \\n further , hysteretic transitions into a state with intermediate resistance occur at high currents , again for both current polarities . \\n these transitions are shown to be consistent with a macrospin model that considers a spin - polarized current that is tilted with respect to the free layer s plane , due to the presence of spin - transfer torque from the polarizing layer . \\n these unique switching characteristics , which have their origin in the non - collinear layer magnetizations , are of interest for magnetic random access memory and spin - torque oscillator devices . ',\n       b' selected results of original numeric simulations of non - linear magnetostatic spin waves and microwave - frequency magnetic chaos in ferrite films are expounded , as third part of the work whose first two parts are recent arxive preprints 1204.0200 and 1204.2423 . especially we consider crucial role of parametric processes in creating the chaos and simultaneously obstacles to its synchronization , and examine some possibilities of good enough synchronization ( to an extent allowing its use for direct secure communication in microwave band ) . ',\n       b' in the present work we study gut coleman - weinberg inflation with a nonminimal coupling to gravity . in this kind of model one \\n usually finds that either the nonminimal coupling to gravity is large @xmath0 or the inflaton self - coupling is unnaturally small @xmath1 . \\n we have shown that the model is in agreement with the recent results from planck for natural values of the couplings .    \\n inflation  @xcite has become the standard paradigm for the early universe , because it solves some outstanding problems present in the standard hot big - bang cosmology , such as the flatness and horizon problems , the problem of unwanted relics , such as magnetic monopoles , and produces the cosmological fluctuations for the formation of the structure that we observe today . \\n the spectacular cmb data , first from the wmap satellite  @xcite and recently from planck  @xcite , have strengthen the inflationary idea , since the observations indicate an _ almost _ scale - free spectrum of gaussian adiabatic density fluctuations , just as predicted by simple models of inflation . however , inflation is not a theory yet , as we do nt know how to integrate it with ideas from particle physics .    \\n the brout - englert - higgs mechanism  @xcite in the framework of the standard model breaks electroweak symmetry , gives masses to the charged fermions and the massive gauge bosons , and predicts the existence of the higgs boson . \\n the recent lhc discovery of the higgs boson  @xcite completed the particle spectrum predicted by the standard model , and indicates for the first time that fundamental scalar particles exist in nature . \\n therefore , it is a natural thing to assume that inflation is driven by the higgs boson . \\n although the higgs potential is not suitable for a viable inflationary model , the presence of a higgs non - minimal coupling to gravity can change things to the better . \\n a large value of the non - minimal coupling @xmath2 is required , and given the uncertainties in the top quark mass and the strong coupling constant the model is still allowed  @xcite . \\n sadly , that large value of @xmath3 questions the validity of the scenario in the sm higgs inflation , as the inflationary scale exceeds the effective ultraviolet cut - off scale  @xcite .    as it was realized long ago \\n , radiative corrections can be the origin of electroweak symmetry breaking  @xcite . \\n the coleman - weinberg mechanism can not work in the standard model due to the large value of the top yukawa coupling , but it can work in models beyond the standard model  @xcite . \\n this is an interesting possibility given the higgs naturalness problem , in the following sense . \\n if heavy particles are coupled to the higgs boson , like in gut models , then the higgs receives large radiative corrections that bring its mass close to the gut mass scale . \\n supersymmetry at the tev scale can solve the problem , but given the severe experimental constraints on the masses of the superpartners , it was proposed recently the flatland scenario  @xcite , according to which electroweak symmetry is broken radiatively a la coleman - weinberg in the infrared region starting from a flat scalar potential in the ultraviolet region .    \\n regarding inflation , the coleman - weinberg type of potential is a simple and well motivated one , since it naturally arises when loop corrections are taken into account , and it is typical for the new inflation scenario  @xcite where inflation takes place near the maximum . \\n recently it has been studied in  @xcite in a b - l extension of the standard model , and a few years ago in  @xcite in a gut inflationary model . as shown in  @xcite in the context of the effective theory of inflation , cosmic microwave background together with large scale structure data \\n prefer double - well inflaton potentials . \\n the 2013 planck data confirmed this result , and not surprisingly the coleman - weinberg potential considered here belongs to this class , and succeeds to reproduce the @xmath4 value and the r bound from the 2013 planck release . \\n however , in  @xcite the inflaton was minimally coupled to gravity . setting @xmath5 , although it is a popular choice , is often unacceptable as was pointed out in  @xcite . \\n non - minimal couplings are generated by quantum corrections even if they are absent in the classical action  @xcite , and as a matter of fact the coupling is required if the scalar field theory is to be renormalizable in a classical gravitational background  @xcite . for early works on non - minimal \\n inflation see for example  @xcite and references therein .    \\n in the present brief report we imagine a scenario where inflation is driven by the scalar sector of some particle physics model beyond the standard model in which electroweak symmetry breaking takes place radiatively a la coleman and weinberg . since the scale of inflation is close to the gut scale \\n , we consider a gut model rather than a low energy one , and we also allow for a non - vanishing non - minimal coupling , as required by the quantum corrections already needed to give rise to the coleman - weinberg type of the inflaton potential . \\n we find that the model is viable as it is in agreement with the recent data from planck , and even more importantly for natural values of the parameters of the model .    \\n we start defining the model by the action @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the non - minimal coupling and @xmath8 with a coleman - weinberg type of potential of the standard form  @xcite @xmath9 where a is related to the inflaton quartic self - coupling  @xcite , and m is the inflaton vacuum expectation value ( vev ) at the minimum , @xmath10 . \\n the vacuum energy density at the origin is given by the constant term @xmath11 so that @xmath12 , and the shape of the potential can be seen in figure  1 , and the inflaton mass is given by @xmath13 . \\n at this point we stress the fact that the coleman - weinberg potential considered in the present work is the standard one obtained from one - loop corrections in minkowski spacetime . \\n the one - loop corrections in de sitter spacetime ( which approximates an inflationary background ) lead to a very different effective potential as shown in  @xcite .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     in summary , in this brief report we have considered a gut inflationary model where inflation is driven by the scalar sector of the model with a coleman - weinberg type of potential for the inflaton and a non - minimal coupling of the inflaton to gravity . \\n as is known , at tree level the @xmath14 potential can not trigger electroweak symmetry breaking , and in addition the corresponding chaotic inflationary model @xmath15 is ruled out by the wmap and planck data . \\n however , quantum loop corrections modify the inflaton potential and at the same time generate the non - minimal coupling term . the model is characterized by two dimensionless parameters , namely the non - minimal coupling @xmath7 and the inflaton quartic self - coupling @xmath16 . \\n we have shown that the model leads to predictions in agreement with the 95 per cent cl contours in the r-@xmath4 plane for natural values of the parameters of the model , both for @xmath7 and @xmath16 of the order of @xmath17 . ',\n       b' we introduce a new simple design of hollow - core microstructured fiber targeted to guide mid - infrared light at a wavelength 2.94 @xmath0 m . \\n the fiber has a triangular - core supported via silica - glass webs enclosed by a large hollow capillary tube . \\n the fiber specific dimensions are determined based on the guiding technique , which is based on the anti - resonant mechanism . for a triangular - core with side length @xmath1 @xmath0 m \\n , the fiber has a minimum transmission loss @xmath2 db / m and dispersion 2.3 ps / km / nm at the operational wavelength 2.94 @xmath0 m . ',\n       b' we introduce various notions of rank for a high order symmetric tensor , namely : rank , border rank , catalecticant rank , generalized rank , scheme length , border scheme length , extension rank and smoothable rank . \\n we analyze the stratification induced by these ranks . \\n the mutual relations between these stratifications , allow us to describe the hierarchy among all the ranks . \\n we show that strict inequalities are possible between rank , border rank , extension rank and catalecticant rank . \\n moreover we show that scheme length , generalized rank and extension rank coincide . ',\n       b' the classical picture of gut baryogenesis has been strongly modified by theoretical progress concerning two nonperturbative features of the standard model : the phase diagram of the electroweak theory , and baryon and lepton number changing sphaleron processes in the high - temperature symmetric phase of the standard model . \\n we briefly review three viable models , electroweak baryogenesis , the affleck - dine mechanism and leptogenesis and discuss the prospects to falsify them . \\n all models are closely tied to the nature of dark matter , especially in supersymmetric theories . in the near future results from lhc and gamma - ray astronomy \\n will shed new light on the origin of the matter - antimatter asymmetry of the universe .     \\n desy-07 - 186 + october 2007 +    address = deutsches elektronen - synchrotron desy , notkestrasse 85 , 22603 hamburg , germany ',\n       b' this article is a continuation of work on construction and calculation various of modifications of invariant based on the use euclidean metric values attributed to elements of manifold triangulation . \\n we again address the well investigated lens spaces as a standard tool for checking the nontriviality of topological invariants .

',\n       b' it was repeatedly underlined in literature that quantum mechanics can not be considered a closed theory if the born rule is postulated rather than derived from the first principles . in this work \\n the born rule is derived from the time - reversal symmetry of quantum equations of motion . \\n the derivation is based on a simple functional equation that takes into account properties of probability , as well as the linearity and time - reversal symmetry of quantum equations of motion . ',\n       b' a bayesian analysis of the world s @xmath0 data is presented . \\n we adopt a regge - plus - resonance framework featuring consistent interactions for nucleon resonances up to spin @xmath1 . \\n the power of the momentum dependence of the consistent interaction structure rises with the spin of the resonance . \\n this leads to unphysical structures in the energy dependence of the computed cross sections when the short - distance physics is cut off with standard hadronic form factors . \\n a plausible , spin - dependent modification of the hadronic form factor is proposed which suppresses the unphysical artifacts . \\n next , we evaluate all possible combinations of 11 candidate resonances . the best model is selected from the 2048 model variants by calculating the bayesian evidence values against the world s @xmath0 data . from the proposed selection of 11 resonances , we find that the following nucleon resonances have the highest probability of contributing to the reaction : @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 .    \\n the @xmath0 reaction : + consistent high - spin interactions and bayesian inference of its resonance content    t.  vrancx , l.  de  cruz , j.  ryckebusch , and p.  vancraeyveld    _ department of physics and astronomy , ghent university , proeftuinstraat 86 , b-9000 gent , belgium _ ',\n       b' we introduce a system of one - dimensional coalescing nonsimple random walks with long range jumps allowing crossing paths and exibiting dependence before coalescence . \\n we show that under diffusive scaling this system converges in distribution to the brownian web . ',\n       b' the microscopic formulas for the shear viscosity @xmath0 , the bulk viscosity @xmath1 , and the corresponding relaxation times @xmath2 and @xmath3 of causal dissipative relativistic fluid - dynamics are obtained at finite temperature and chemical potential by using the projection operator method . \\n the non - triviality of the finite chemical potential calculation is attributed to the arbitrariness of the operator definition for the bulk viscous pressure . \\n we show that , when the operator definition for the bulk viscous pressure @xmath4 is appropriately chosen , the leading - order result of the ratio , @xmath1 over @xmath3 , coincides with the same ratio obtained at vanishing chemical potential . \\n we further discuss the physical meaning of the time - convolutionless ( tcl ) approximation to the memory function , which is adopted to derive the main formulas . \\n we show that the tcl approximation violates the time reversal symmetry appropriately and leads results consistent with the quantum master equation obtained by van hove . \\n furthermore , this approximation can reproduce an exact relation for transport coefficients obtained by using the f - sum rule derived by kadanoff and martin . \\n our approach can reproduce also the result in baier et al.(2008 ) ref . \\n @xcite by taking into account the next - order correction to the tcl approximation , although this correction causes several problems . ',\n       b' we report the discovery of a @xmath0 quasi - periodic oscillation ( qpo ) in the x - ray emission from a bright ultra - luminous x - ray source ( ulx ) holmberg ix x-1 using a long _ xmm - newton _ observation . \\n the qpo has a centroid at @xmath1 , a coherence @xmath2 and an amplitude ( rms ) of @xmath3 in the @xmath4 band . \\n this is only the second detection of a qpo from an ulx , after m  82 x-1 , and provides strong evidence against beaming . \\n the power spectrum is well fitted by a power law with an index of @xmath5 . the total integrated power ( rms ) \\n is @xmath6 in the @xmath7 range . \\n the x - ray spectrum shows clear evidence for a soft x - ray excess component that is well described by a multicolor disk blackbody ( @xmath8 ) and a high energy curvature that can be modeled either by a cut - off power law ( @xmath9 ; @xmath10 ) or as a strongly comptonized continuum in an optically thick ( @xmath11 ) and cool ( @xmath12 ) plasma . \\n both the presence of the qpo and the shape of the x - ray spectrum strongly suggest that the ulx is not in the high / soft or thermally dominated state . \\n a truncated disk and inner optically thick corona may explain the observed x - ray spectrum and the presence of the qpo . ',\n       b\" the aim of this paper is to derive a new equation ( the _ acoustic - drift equation _ ( ade ) ) describing the generation of a flow by an acoustic wave . \\n we consider acoustic waves of perfect barotropic gas as the zero - order solution and derive the equation for the averaged flow of the first order . \\n the used small parameter of our asymptotic study is dimensionless inverse frequency , and the leading term for a velocity field is chosen to be a purely oscillating acoustic field . \\n the employed mathematical approach combines the two - timing method and the notion of a distinguished limit . \\n the properties of commutators are used to simplify calculations . \\n the derived averaged equation is similar to the original vorticity equation , where the reynolds stresses has been transformed to an additional advection with the drift velocity . \\n hence ade can be seen as a compressible version of the craik - leibovich equation . in particular \\n , ade shows that if the averaged vorticity is absent in the initial data , then it will always be equal to zero . \\n this property confirms that the acoustic streaming is of viscous nature . at the same time ade \\n can be useful for the description of secondary motions which take place for ` strong ' acoustic streaming flow . \",\n       b' we characterize the carrier density profile of the ground state of graphene in the presence of particle - particle interaction and random charged impurity for zero gate voltage . \\n we provide detailed analysis on the resulting spatially inhomogeneous electron gas taking into account the particle - particle interaction and the remote coulomb disorder on an equal footing within the thomas - fermi - dirac theory . \\n we present some general features of the carrier density probability measure of the graphene sheet . \\n we also show that , when viewed as a random surface , the resulting electron - hole puddles at zero chemical potential show peculiar self - similar statistical properties . \\n although the disorder potential is chosen to be gaussian , we show that the charge field is non - gaussian with unusual kondev relations which can be regarded as a new class of two - dimensional ( 2d ) random - field surfaces . ',\n       b' in this paper we give a complete description of the set @xmath0 of discrete faithful representations of the fundamental group of a compact , orientable , hyperbolizable 3-manifold with incompressible boundary , equipped with the strong topology , with the description given in term of the end invariants of the quotient manifolds . as part of this description , we introduce coordinates on @xmath0 that extend the usual ahlfors - bers coordinates . \\n we use these coordinates to show the local connectivity of @xmath0 and study the action of the modular group of @xmath1 on @xmath0 . ',\n       b\" we discuss a novel instability in inertia - less electron magneto - hydrodynamics ( emhd ) , which arises from a combination of electron velocity shear and electron density gradients . \\n the unstable modes have a lengthscale longer than the transverse density scale , and a growth - rate of the order of the inverse hall timescale . \\n we suggest that this density - shear instability  may be of importance in magnetic reconnection regions on scales smaller than the ion skin depth , and in neutron star crusts . \\n we demonstrate that the so - called hall drift instability , previously argued to be relevant in neutron star crusts , is a resistive tearing instability rather than an instability of the hall term itself . \\n we argue that the density - shear instability  is of greater significance in neutron stars than the tearing instability , because it generally has a faster growth - rate and is less sensitive to geometry and boundary conditions . \\n we prove that , for uniform electron density , emhd is `` at least as stable '' as regular , incompressible mhd , in the sense that any field configuration that is stable in mhd is also stable in emhd . \\n we present a connection between the density - shear instability  in emhd and the magneto - buoyancy instability in anelastic mhd . \",\n       b' dielectric nano - swithes made of the materials that exhibit piezoelectric and/or flexoelectric properties with significant electro - mechanical coupling are considered . in this case \\n , a nonuniform strain field may locally break inversion symmetry and induce polarization even in nonpiezoelectrics . at reducing dimensions to the nanoscale \\n , the flexoelectric effect demonstrates the nonlocality of the dielectric materials and plays more significant role than piezoelectric effect . the flexoelectric effect is included into consideration via additional term coupling strain gradient and polarization in the electric enthalpy density . \\n the equations of motion of the improved euler - bernoulli and timoshenko beam models , and 2-d plate theory have been obtained . ',\n       b' we describe methods for the fast production of highly coherent - spin - squeezed many - body states in bosonic josephson junctions ( bjjs ) . \\n we start from the known mapping of the two - site bose - hubbard ( bh ) hamiltonian to that of a single effective particle evolving according to a schrdinger - like equation in fock space . \\n since , for repulsive interactions , the effective potential in fock space is nearly parabolic , we extend recently derived protocols for shortcuts to adiabatic evolution in harmonic potentials to the many - body bh hamiltonian . \\n a comparison with current experiments shows that our methods allow for an important reduction in the preparation times of highly squeezed spin states . ',\n       b' we use x - ray monitoring data obtained over a broad range of time - scales to measure the broadband power spectral density functions ( psds ) of two seyfert galaxies , the broad line seyfert  1 ngc  3227 and the seyfert  2 ngc  5506 , which has recently been identified as an obscured narrow line seyfert  1 ( nls  1 ) . using a monte - carlo fitting technique \\n we demonstrate that both psds are reminiscent of the psd of black hole x - ray binaries ( bhxrbs ) in the high / soft state , and specifically rule out a low / hard state psd shape in ngc  3227 . \\n this result demonstrates that , at least where variability is concerned , broad line seyferts with hard x - ray spectra ( photon index @xmath0 ) are not simply the analogues of the low / hard state in bhxrbs , and the dichotomy of nls  1 and broad line seyferts can not be simply interpreted in terms of the two states . \\n we show that the psd normalisation in ngc  3227 is strongly energy dependent , with larger variability amplitudes at lower energies , unlike ngc  5506 which shows little energy - dependence of variability . \\n we demonstrate that this difference is caused by spectral pivoting of the continuum in ngc  3227 at high energies , which is probably also related to the large amplitude of variability seen in the 2 - 10  kev band in this agn . using the new psd data and new results in the literature , we replot the psd break time - scale versus mass plot for all agn with psd breaks measured so far , and demonstrate that higher accretion -

magnitude diagrams . \\n we have made some suggestions to improve the accuracy of temperature estimates in sed fitter .    in most cases \\n these parameters of individual stars from sed fitter in a star forming region ( sfr ) or in the whole cluster showed nearly no systematic variation with age or with any other relevant parameter . on the other hand \\n , the median properties of stars in ngc 2264 sfrs showed an evident evolutionary effect and were interrelated to each other . \\n such differences are caused by a larger age spread within an sfr than between them .    \\n the cumulative distribution of stellar ages showed a distinct difference among sfrs . \\n a kolmogorov - smirnov test gave a very low probability of them being from the same population . \\n the results indicate that star formation in ngc 2264 started at the surface region ( halo and field regions ) about 6  7 myr ago , propagated into the molecular cloud and finally triggered the recent star formation in the spokes cluster . \\n the kind of sequential star formation that started in the low - density surface region ( halo and field regions ) implies that star formation in ngc 2264 was triggered by an external source .    \\n the imf of ngc 2264 was determined in two different ways . \\n one method used the stellar mass from the sed fitting tool , the other used the stellar mass from color - magnitude diagrams . \\n the first imf showed a distinct peak at m @xmath0 2m@xmath1 , but the second did not . \\n we attribute the peak as an artifact of the sed fitting tool because there is no such imf with a peak at m @xmath0 2m@xmath1 . \\n the slope of the imf of ngc 2264 for massive stars ( @xmath2 ) is -1.7 @xmath3 0.1 , which is somewhat steeper than the so -

',\n       b' we study possible topological features of kondo spin liquid phase in terms of the one- and two - dimensional kondo necklace models within the frame work of quantum o(n ) non - liner sigma model ( nlsm ) . in the one - dimensional case \\n , it is found that the bulk properties of the kodno spin liquid phase are similar to the well - known haldane phase at strong coupling fixed point . \\n the difference between them mainly comes from their boundaries due to the effect of the topological term . in the two - dimensional case \\n , the system can be mapped onto an o(4)-like nlsm with some o(3 ) anisotropy . \\n interestingly , we find that if hedgehog - like point defects are included together with the restoration of the full o(4 ) symmetry , our model is identical to a kind of su(2 ) symmetry - protected topological ( spt ) state . \\n additionally , if the system has the o(5 ) symmetry instead , the effective nlsm with wess - zumino - witten term is just a description of the surface modes of a three - dimensional spt state , though such o(5 ) nlsm could not be a proper description of kondo spin liquid phase due to its gaplessness . \\n we expect that the discussions might provide useful threads to identify certain microscopic bilayer antiferromagnet models ( and related materials ) , which can support the desirable spt states . ',\n       b' the concept of continuous - time random walks ( ctrw ) is a generalization of ordinary random walk models , and it is a powerful tool for investigating a broad spectrum of phenomena in natural , engineering , social and economic sciences . \\n recently , several theoretical approaches have been developed that allowed to analyze explicitly dynamics of ctrw at all times , which is critically important for understanding mechanisms of underlying phenomena . \\n however , theoretical analysis has been done mostly for systems with a simple geometry . here \\n we extend the original method based on generalized master equations to analyze all - time dynamics of ctrw models on complex networks . \\n specific calculations are performed for models on lattices with branches and for models on coupled parallel - chain lattices . \\n exact expressions for velocities and dispersions are obtained . \\n generalized fluctuations theorems for ctrw models on complex networks are discussed .

level atom in a cascade configuration with both transitions coupled to a single structured reservoir of quantized field modes is treated using laplace transform methods applied to the coupled amplitude equations . \\n results are also obtained from master equations by two different approaches , that is , involving either pseudomodes or quasimodes . \\n two different types of reservoir are considered , namely a high - q cavity and a photonic band - gap system , in which the respective reservoir structure functions involve lorentzians . non - resonant transitions are included in the model . in all cases non - markovian behaviour for the atomic system can be found , such as oscillatory decay for the high - q cavity case and population trapping for the photonic band - gap case . in the master equation \\n approaches , the atomic system is augmented by a small number of pseudomodes or quasimodes , which in the quasimode approach themselves undergo markovian relaxation into a flat reservoir of continuum quasimodes . \\n results from these methods are found to be identical to those from the laplace transform method including two - photon excitation of the reservoir with both emitting sequences . \\n this shows that complicated non - markovian decays of an atomic system into structured em field reservoirs can be described by markovian models for the atomic system coupled to a small number of pseudomodes or quasimodes . ',\n       b' in this paper , we address which sources contributed most of the reionizing photons . \\n our argument assumes that the reionization ended around @xmath0 and that it was a relatively quick process , i.e. , that there was a non - negligible fraction of neutral hydrogen in the universe at somewhat earlier epochs . starting from our earlier estimate of the luminosity function ( lf ) of galaxies at @xmath0 \\n , we quantitatively show that the major sources of reionization are most likely galaxies with @xmath1 . \\n our approach allows us to put stronger constraints to the lf of galaxies at @xmath0 . to have the universe completely ionized at this redshift \\n , the faint - end slope of the lf should be steeper than @xmath2 , which is the value measured at lower redshifts ( @xmath3 ) , unless either the normalization ( @xmath4 ) of the lf or the clumping factor of the ionized hydrogen has been significantly underestimated . if @xmath4 is actually lower than what we assumed by a factor of two , a steep slope close to @xmath5 is required . \\n our lf predicts a total of 50  80 @xmath0 galaxies in the hst ultra deep field ( udf ) to a depth of @xmath6 mag , which can be used to constraint both @xmath4 and @xmath7 . \\n we conclude that the @xmath8 luminous galaxies existing at this redshift should reach as low as some critical luminosity in order to accumulate the entire reionizing photon budget . on the other hand , \\n the existence of significant amounts of neutral hydrogen at slightly earlier epochs , e.g. @xmath9 , requires that the @xmath8 luminous galaxies should not be fainter than another critical value ( i.e. , the lf should cut - off at this point ) . ',\n       b' the third us naval observatory ( usno ) ccd astrograph catalog , ucac3 was released at the iau general assembly on 2009 august 10 . \\n it is the first all - sky release in this series and contains just over 100 million objects , about 95 million of them with proper motions , covering about r = 8 to 16 magnitudes . \\n current epoch positions are obtained from the observations with the 20 cm aperture usno astrograph s  red lens \" , equipped with a 4k by 4k ccd . \\n proper motions are derived by combining these observations with over 140 ground- and space - based catalogs , including hipparcos / tycho and the ac2000.2 , as well as unpublished measures of over 5000 plates from other astrographs . for most of the faint stars in the southern hemisphere \\n the yale / san juan first epoch plates from the spm program ( ysj1 ) form the basis for proper motions . \\n these data are supplemented by all - sky schmidt plate survey astrometry and photometry obtained from the supercosmos project , as well as 2mass near - ir photometry . \\n major differences of ucac3 data as compared to ucac2 include a completely new raw data reduction with improved control over systematic errors in positions , significantly improved photometry , slightly deeper limiting magnitude , coverage of the north pole region , greater completeness by inclusion of double stars and weak detections . \\n this of course leads to a catalog which is not as  clean \" as ucac2 and problem areas are outlined for the user in this paper . \\n the positional accuracy of stars in ucac3 is about 15 to 100 mas per coordinate , depending on magnitude , while the errors in proper motions range from 1 to 10 mas / yr depending on magnitude and observing history , with a significant improvement over ucac2 achieved due to the re - reduced spm data and inclusion of more astrograph plate data unavailable at the time of ucac2 . ',\n       b' we show that a dynamical supersymmetry can appear in a purely fermionic system . \\n this  supersymmetry without bosons \" is constructed by application of a recently introduced boson - fermion dyson mapping from a fermion space to a space comprised of collective bosons and ideal fermions . in some algebraic fermion models of nuclear structure \\n , particular hamiltonians may lead to collective spectra of even and odd nuclei that can be unified using the dynamical supersymmetry concept with pauli correlations exactly taken into account . ',\n       b' we present the results of a survey for trans - neptunian objects ( tnos ) based on subaru archival images , originally collected by @xcite as part of a search for irregular satellites of uranus . \\n the survey region covers @xmath0 , centered on uranus and observed near opposition on two adjacent nights . \\n our survey reaches half its maximum detection efficiency at @xmath1=@xmath2 . \\n the objects detected correspond to 82  tnos , five  centaurs , and five  irregular satellites . \\n we model the cumulative number of tnos brighter than a given apparent magnitude with both a single and double power law . \\n the best fit single power law , with one object per square degree at magnitude @xmath3=@xmath4 and a slope of @xmath5=@xmath6 , is inconsistent with the results of similar searches with shallower limiting magnitudes . \\n the best fit double power law , with a bright - end slope @xmath7=@xmath8 , a faint - end slope @xmath9=@xmath10 , a differential number density at @xmath11 @xmath12=@xmath13 and a magnitude break in the slope at @xmath14=@xmath15 , is more likely than the single power law by a bayes factor of @xmath1626 . \\n this is the first survey with sufficient depth and areal coverage to identify the magnitude at which the break occurs without relying on the results of other surveys .    \\n we estimate barycentric distances for the 73 objects that have 24  hr arcs ; only two have heliocentric distances as large as @xmath16@xmath17 . \\n we combine the distribution of observed distances with the size distribution that corresponds to a double power law luminosity function to set a tight constraint on the existence of a distant tno population . \\n we can exclude such a population at 60@xmath18 , with 95% confidence , assuming it has the same size distribution and albedo as the observed tnos , if it exceeds 8% of mass of the observed tnos . ',\n       b' the unparticle stuff scenario related to the notrivial ir fixed point in 4d - conformal field theory is recently suggested by georgi . we illustrate its physical effects in deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) process . \\n a possible signal of unparticle related to parity violation asymmetry in dis is investigated . \\n it is found out that the behavior of this parity violation signal is sensitive to the value of the scale dimension @xmath0 of unpaticle .    \\n 0.5 cm    pacs numbers:14.80.-j , 12.90.+b , 12.38.-t , 13.60.hb '],\n      dtype=object)\n'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'decode'",

',\n       b\" we point out that protoplanets created in the framework of the tidal downsizing ( td ) theory for planet formation play a very important role for the evolution of accretion discs hosting them . \\n since all td protoplanets are initially as massive as @xmath0 jupiter masses , they are able to open very deep gaps in their discs , and even completely isolate the inner disc flows from the outer ones . \\n furthermore , in contrast to other planet formation theories , td protoplanets are mass donors for their protostars . \\n one potentially observable signature of planets being devoured by their protostars are fu ori like outbursts , and episodic protostar accretion more generally , as discussed by a number of authors recently .    here we explore another observational implication of td hypothesis : dust poor inner accretion flows , which we believe may be relevant to some of the observed mm - bright transitional discs around protostars . in our model \\n , a massive protoplanet interrupts the flow of the outer dust - rich disc on its protostar , and at the same time looses a part of its dust - poor envelope into the inner disc . \\n this then powers the observed gas - but - no - dust accretion onto the star . upon a more detailed investigation \\n , we find that this scenario is quite natural for young massive discs but is less so for older discs , e.g. , those whose self - gravitating phase has terminated a fraction of a million year or more ago . \\n this stems from the fact that td protoplanets of such an age should have contracted significantly , and so are unlikely to loose much mass . \\n therefore , we conclude that either ( i ) the population of `` transition discs '' with large holes and dust - poor accretion is much younger than generally believed ; or ( ii ) there is a poorly understood stage for late removal of dust - poor envelopes from td planets ; ( iii ) another explanation for the observations is correct .    \\n [ firstpage ] \",\n       b' we investigate theoretically the nonequilibrium finite - frequency current noise in a four - terminal quantum point contact of interacting helical edge states at a finite bias voltage . \\n special focus is put on the effects of the single - particle and two - particle scattering between the two helical edge states on the fractional charge quasiparticle excitations shown in the nonequilibrium current noise spectra . via the keldysh perturbative approach \\n , we find that the effects of the single - particle and the two - particle scattering processes on the current noise depend sensitively on the luttinger liquid parameter . \\n moreover , the fano factors for the auto- and cross correlations of the currents in the terminals are distinct from the ones for tunneling between the chiral edge states in the quantum hall liquid . \\n the current noise spectra in the single - particle - scattering - dominated and the two - particle - scattering - dominated regime are shown . \\n experimental implications of our results on the transport through the helical edges in two - dimensional topological insulators are discussed . ',\n       b' the classical kummer construction attaches to an abelian surface a k3 surface . as shioda and katsura showed , \\n this construction breaks down for supersingular abelian surfaces in characteristic two . replacing supersingular abelian surfaces by the selfproduct of the rational cuspidal curve , and the sign involution by suitable infinitesimal group scheme actions , \\n i give the correct kummer - type construction for this situation . \\n we encounter rational double points of type @xmath0 and @xmath1 , instead of type @xmath2 . \\n it turns out that the resulting surfaces are supersingular k3 surfaces with artin invariant one and two . \\n they lie in a 1-dimensional family obtained by simultaneous resolution , which exists after purely inseparable base change . ',\n       b' object - oriented application programing interfaces ( apis ) support software reuse by providing pre - implemented functionalities . due to the huge number of included classes , reusing and understanding large apis is a complex task . otherwise , software components are admitted to be more reusable and understandable entities than object - oriented ones . \\n thus , in this paper , we propose an approach for reengineering object- oriented apis into component - based ones . \\n we mine components as a group of classes based on the frequency they are used together and their ability to form a quality - centric component . to validate our approach \\n , we experimented on 100 _ java _ applications that used _ android _ apis .

',\n       b' we perform a numerical simulation of quantum turbulence produced by thermal counterflow in superfluid @xmath0he by using the vortex filament model with the full biot  savart law . \\n the pioneering work of schwarz has two shortcomings : it neglects the non - local terms of the biot  savart integral ( known as the localized induction approximation , lia ) and it employs an unphysical mixing procedure to sustain the statistically steady state of turbulence . for the first time we have succeeded in generating the statistically steady state under periodic boundary conditions without using the lia or the mixing procedure . \\n this state exhibits the characteristic relation @xmath1 between the line - length density @xmath2 and the counterflow relative velocity @xmath3 and there is quantitative agreement between the coefficient @xmath4 and some measured values . \\n the parameter @xmath4 and some anisotropy parameters are calculated as functions of temperature and the counterflow relative velocity . \\n the numerical results obtained using the full biot  savart law are compared with those obtained using the lia . \\n the lia calculation constructs a layered structure of vortices and does not proceed to a turbulent state but rather to another anisotropic vortex state ; thus , the lia is not suitable for simulations of turbulence . ',\n       b' recent high - statistics au+au and cu+cu runs at rhic have provided a wealth of new data that allow star to answer several outstanding questions regarding the nature of the hot , dense medium that is created in ultrarelativistic heavy - ion collisions . \\n however , the new data also raise new questions that require further study . here \\n , we focus on a few qualitatively new results presented by star for the first time at quark matter  05 .

today  @xcite \\n while there is little room left to doubt the existence of dm , its microscopic properties are virtually unknown . \\n one of the few properties in which we can be confident is that dm should be stable on time scales greater than the age of the universe , suggesting the existence of a new `` dark '' symmetry . \\n but precisely what symmetry stabilizes dm is a mystery .    \\n many models employ a discrete @xmath2 symmetry to stabilize dm . \\n this @xmath2 symmetry is often motivated by the need to suppress dangerous operators in new physics scenarios that solve the hierarchy problem . \\n however , given that we have no experimental indication of what new physics , if any , addresses the naturalness issues in the sm , one may take a more general perspective regarding dm and the symmetries responsible for its stability . \\n more pragmatically , the exploration of alternative stabilizing symmetries is warranted by the prospect of novel phenomena associated with dm , as such symmetries may predict new states and interactions .    \\n indeed , there are many possibilities other than a @xmath2-parity that can protect dm against decay . in particular , besides the abelian cyclic symmetry @xmath3  @xcite , dm may well be stabilized by a non - abelian discrete symmetry . \\n non - abelian finite groups have received some limited attention

component nature of dm can potentially be tested at future ton - scale experiments .    \\n while we have focused on the phenomenology relevant for direct detection experiments , the @xmath1 model also has implications for high energy colliders and indirect detection probes . at colliders , the most important consequence of the @xmath1 model , like other models in which dm couples to the sm through the higgs portal , is to cause the higgs boson to decay invisibly if kinematically allowed . \\n an invisibly decaying higgs boson can be discovered using the vector boson fusion and @xmath251 production channels at the lhc ( @xmath252 tev ) with 30 fb@xmath253 of data  @xcite . \\n another generic dm collider probe is a monojet produced in association with pairs of dark matter particles  @xcite . in scalar singlet dm models , this occurs via gluon fusion accompanied by emission of a jet . \\n while the tevatron is not sensitive to the monojet signature in this class of dm models , the lhc could potentially probe regions with large higgs portal couplings @xmath254  @xcite . \\n we also note that a more complete study of the monojet signature in higgs portal dm models going beyond the effective field theory approach is warranted given that a relatively light higgs and a top quark loop enter into the amplitude .    \\n a potential indirect probe of the @xmath1 model is to observe gamma rays from annihilating @xmath28 or @xmath29 particles . \\n in particular , fermi - lat data on the isotropic gamma - ray diffuse emission  @xcite , depending on various astrophysical assumptions , can constrain low mass @xmath255 gev dm particles annihilating through the higgs portal  @xcite . for such constraints to be relevant \\n , the lightest component should carry most of the cosmic dm abundance , since the gamma - ray flux scales as the square of the dm density . \\n in particular , light dm particles with very large higgs portal couplings will be depleted efficiently and therefore not subject to such constraints . \\n another possibility is to observe monochromatic gamma -

abelian finite groups , and ultimately non - abelian discrete gauge symmetries as the origin of dm stability . finally , given that non - abelian discrete symmetries may underlie the patterns observed in the quark and lepton masses and mixings , it is interesting to speculate that dm stability may intimately be connected to flavor symmetries .    \\n stability on cosmological time scales constitutes one of the few and robust guiding principles in formulation of a theory of dark matter . \\n alternatives to the canonical @xmath2 parity symmetry may lead to new phenomena associated with dark matter , as has been clearly demonstrated by our study of the minimal model of @xmath1 dark matter . \\n we anticipate that new data from a variety of experimental and observational fronts will soon bring us closer in unraveling the particle nature of dark matter and the symmetry which protects its lifetime .      \\n we thank francesco deramo , andreas hohenegger , chris jillings , alexander kartavtsev , rafael lang , maxim pospelov , and jesse thaler for helpful discussions and correspondence . \\n research at the perimeter institute is supported in part by the government of canada through nserc and by the province of ontario through medt . \\n research at max -

',\n       b' this article reviews the application of the non - equilibrium green s function formalism to the simulation of novel photovoltaic devices utilizing quantum confinement effects in low dimensional absorber structures . \\n it covers well - known aspects of the fundamental negf theory for a system of interacting electrons , photons and phonons with relevance for the simulation of optoelectronic devices and introduces at the same time new approaches to the theoretical description of the elementary processes of photovoltaic device operation , such as photogeneration via coherent excitonic absorption , phonon - mediated indirect optical transitions or non - radiative recombination via defect states . \\n while the description of the theoretical framework is kept as general as possible , two specific prototypical quantum photovoltaic devices , a single quantum well photodiode and a silicon - oxide based superlattice absorber , are used to illustrated the kind of unique insight that numerical simulations based on the theory are able to provide . ',\n       b' analyses of spectra obtained with the _ far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer ( fuse ) _ satellite , together with spectra from the _ copernicus _ and _ imaps _ instruments , reveal an unexplained very wide range in the observed deuterium / hydrogen ( d / h ) ratios for interstellar gas in the galactic disk beyond the local bubble . \\n we argue that spatial variations in the depletion of deuterium onto dust grains can explain these local variations in the observed gas - phase d / h ratios . \\n we present a variable deuterium depletion model that naturally explains the constant measured values of d / h inside the local bubble , the wide range of gas - phase d / h ratios observed in the intermediate regime ( @xmath0 19.220.7 ) , and the low gas - phase d / h ratios observed at larger hydrogen column densities . \\n we consider empirical tests of the deuterium depletion hypothesis : ( i ) correlations of gas - phase d / h ratios with depletions of the refractory metals iron and silicon , and ( ii ) correlation with the h@xmath1 rotational temperature . \\n both of these tests are consistent with deuterium depletion from the gas phase in cold , not recently shocked , regions of the ism , and high gas - phase d / h ratios in gas that has been shocked or otherwise heated recently . \\n we argue that the most representative value for the total ( gas plus dust ) d / h ratio within 1 kpc of the sun is @xmath2 ( 1  @xmath3 ) parts per million ( ppm ) . \\n this ratio constrains galactic chemical evolution models to have a very small deuterium astration factor , the ratio of primordial to total ( d / h ) ratio in the local region of the galactic disk , which we estimate to be @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) or @xmath6 ( @xmath5 ) depending on the adopted light element nuclear reaction rates . ',\n       b' the excursion set approach allows one to estimate the abundance and spatial distribution of virialized dark matter haloes efficiently and accurately . \\n the predictions of this approach depend on how the nonlinear processes of collapse and virialization are modelled . \\n we present simple analytic approximations which allow us to compare the excursion set predictions associated with spherical and ellipsoidal collapse . \\n in particular , we present formulae for the universal unconditional mass function of bound objects and the conditional mass function which describes the mass function of the progenitors of haloes in a given mass range today . \\n we show that the ellipsoidal collapse based moving barrier model provides a better description of what we measure in the numerical simulations than the spherical collapse based constant barrier model , although the agreement between model and simulations is better at large lookback times . \\n our results for the conditional mass function can be used to compute accurate approximations to the local - density mass function which quantifies the tendency for massive haloes to populate denser regions than less massive haloes . \\n this happens because low - density regions can be thought of as being collapsed haloes viewed at large lookback times , whereas high - density regions are collapsed haloes viewed at small lookback times . \\n although we have only applied our analytic formulae to two simple barrier shapes , we show that they are , in fact , accurate for a wide variety of moving barriers . \\n we suggest how they can be used to study the case in which the initial dark matter distribution is not completely cold .    \\n galaxies : clustering  cosmology : theory  dark matter .

'' in a three - flavor treatment , the step - like feature actually consists of two narrowly spaced splits . \\n they are determined by two combinations of flavor - lepton numbers that are conserved under collective oscillations . \",\n       b' quantum state teleportation of optical number states is conspicuously absent from the list of experimental milestones achieved to date  @xcite . \\n here we demonstrate analytically a teleportation scheme with fidelity @xmath0 for optical number states of arbitrary dimension using linear optical elements only . to this end \\n , we develop an epr source to supply bell - type states for the teleportation , and show how the same set - up can also be used as a bell - state analyser ( bsa ) when implemented in a time - reversal manner . \\n these two aspects are then brought together to complete the teleportation protocol in a scheme that can deliver perfect fidelity , albeit with an efficiency that decays exponentially as the occupation of the number states increases stepwise . \\n the epr source and bsa schemes both consist of two optical axes in a symmetrical v - shape experimental layout , along which beam - splitters are placed cross - beam fashion at regular intervals , with their transmittivities treated as variables for which the values are calculated _ ad hoc_. in particular , we show the full treatment for the case of qutrit teleportation , and calculate the transmittivity values of the beam splitters required for teleporting qubits , qutrits , qupentits , quheptits and qunits . the general case for arbitrary - dimensional number state teleportation \\n is demonstrated through a counting argument .    \\n photons ( interchangeably referred to as optical number - states or fock - states ) are bosons . \\n unlike fermionic electrons , they have the property that they can fly undisturbed since they do not interact with each other . \\n this can be used to great advantage particularly in areas such as quantum communication and information processing where an ideal transmission medium would have the property that it could carry information without degrading it , i.e. that the received information would have a perfect fidelity of @xmath1 . in this respect , \\n photons represent the medium of choice and offer significant advantages over electronic channels . \\n but since they do not interact , they are also difficult to control ( compared to electrons ) . \\n +   + this paper offers a generalisation of the teleportation protocol to an arbitrary dimension of optical number states . \\n its generality sets it apart from previous teleportation schemes . \\n the first laboratory implementations of teleportation , performed by bouwmeester et al .  \\n @xcite and boschi et al .  \\n @xcite , succeeded in teleporting a photon s polarisation state , that is , an internal degree of freedom . \\n a more general scheme was implemented by furusawa et al .  \\n @xcite , where a coherent state of light was teleported via continuous variables  @xcite , that is , a subset of the spatial degree of freedom . \\n a third and more general type of teleportation was realised for a single optical number state in superposition with the vacuum state  @xcite . \\n we take this as our starting point , and extend the idea of number state teleportation to arbitrarily large states . ',\n       b' we theoretically investigate the creation of squeezed states of a bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) trapped in a magnetic double well potential . the number or phase squeezed states are created by modulating the tunnel coupling between the two wells periodically with twice the josephson frequency , i.e. , through parametric amplification . \\n simulations are performed with the multi configurational hartree method for bosons ( mctdhb ) . \\n we employ optimal control theory to bring the condensate to a complete halt at a final time , thus creating a highly squeezed state ( squeezing factor of 0.12 , @xmath0 db ) suitable for atom interferometry . ',\n       b' we show that a star orbiting close enough to an adiabatically grown supermassive black hole can capture a large number of weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) during its lifetime . \\n wimp annihilation energy release in low- to medium - mass stars is comparable with or even exceeds the luminosity of such stars due to thermonuclear burning . \\n the excessive energy release in the stellar core may result in an evolution scenario different from what is expected for a regular star . \\n the model thus predicts the existence of unusual stars within the central parsec of galactic nuclei . \\n if found , such stars would provide evidence for the existence of particle dark matter . \\n white dwarfs seem to be the most promising candidates to look for . \\n the signature of a white dwarf burning wimps would be a very hot star with mass and radius characteristic for a white dwarf , but with luminosity exceeding the typical luminosity of a white dwarf by orders of magnitude @xmath0@xmath1 . \\n a white dwarf with a highly eccentric orbit around the central black hole may exhibit variations in brightness correlated with the orbital phase . ',\n       b' the existence of large - scale dynamos in rigidly rotating turbulent convection without shear is studied using three - dimensional numerical simulations of penetrative rotating compressible convection . \\n we demonstrate that rotating convection in a cartesian domain can drive a large - scale dynamo even in the absence of shear . \\n the large - scale field contains a significant fraction of the total field in the saturated state . \\n the simulation results are compared with one - dimensional mean - field dynamo models where turbulent transport coefficients , as determined using the test field method , are used . \\n the reason for the absence of large - scale dynamo action in earlier studies is shown to be due to the rotation being too slow : whereas the @xmath0-effect can change sign , its magnitude stays approximately constant as a function of rotation , and the turbulent diffusivity decreases monotonically with increasing rotation . \\n only when rotation is rapid enough a large - scale dynamo can be excited . \\n the one - dimensional mean - field model with dynamo coefficients from the test field results predicts reasonably well the dynamo excitation in the direct simulations . \\n this result further validates the test field procedure and reinforces the interpretation that the observed dynamo is driven by a turbulent @xmath0-effect . \\n this result demonstrates the existence of an @xmath0-effect and an @xmath1-dynamo with natural forcing . ',\n       b' the theory of highly super - eddington black hole accretion , @xmath0 , was developed in the 1980s in warsaw by paczyski and his collaborators @xcite@xcite in terms of _ polish doughnuts_@xmath1 , i.e. low viscosity , rotating accretion flows that are optically thick , radiation pressure supported , cooled by advection , and radiatively very inefficient . \\n polish doughnuts resemble fat tori with two narrow funnels along rotation axis . the funnels collimate radiation into beams with highly super - eddington luminosities . _ slim disks _ introduced later by abramowicz , lasota and collaborators first in @xcite , and more fully in @xcite have only moderately super - eddington accretion rates , @xmath2 , rather disk - like shapes , and almost thermal spectra @xcite-@xcite . ',\n       b' the fully self - consistent random phase approximation ( rpa ) is constructed within the unitary correlation operator method ( ucom ) , which describes the dominant interaction - induced short - range central and tensor correlations by a unitary transformation . \\n based on the correlated argonne v18 interaction , the rpa is employed in studies of multipole response in closed - shell nuclei across the nuclide chart . \\n the ucom - rpa results in a collective character of giant resonances , and it describes rather well the properties of isoscalar giant monopole resonances . \\n however , the excitation energies of isovector giant dipole resonances and isoscalar giant quadrupole resonances are overestimated due to the missing long - range correlations and three - body contributions . ',\n       b' it has been thought for many years that the milky way is an overly large spiral galaxy . \\n using cephied distances to 17 spiral galaxies we calculate the true linear diameters of those galaxies . \\n these diameters are then compared to that of the milky way which is found to be , at most , an averagely sized spiral galaxy . when compared to galaxies of approximately the same hubble type ( @xmath0 ) the milky way is found to be slightly undersized . \\n this suggests that the hubble parameter is at the lower end of the currently accepted range of possibilities . ',\n       b' we demonstrate current - induced bipolar switching in in - plane magnetized spin - valve devices that incorporate a perpendicularly magnetized spin polarizing layer . \\n further , hysteretic transitions into a state with intermediate resistance occur at high currents , again for both current polarities . \\n these transitions are shown to be consistent with a macrospin model that considers a spin - polarized current that is tilted with respect to the free layer s plane , due to the presence of spin - transfer torque from the polarizing layer . \\n these unique switching characteristics , which have their origin in the non - collinear layer magnetizations , are of interest for magnetic random access memory and spin - torque oscillator devices . ',\n       b' selected results of original numeric simulations of non - linear magnetostatic spin waves and microwave - frequency magnetic chaos in ferrite films are expounded , as third part of the work whose first two parts are recent arxive preprints 1204.0200 and 1204.2423 . especially we consider crucial role of parametric processes in creating the chaos and simultaneously obstacles to its synchronization , and examine some possibilities of good enough synchronization ( to an extent allowing its use for direct secure communication in microwave band ) . ',\n       b' in the present work we study gut coleman - weinberg inflation with a nonminimal coupling to gravity . in this kind of model one \\n usually finds that either the nonminimal coupling to gravity is large @xmath0 or the inflaton self - coupling is unnaturally small @xmath1 . \\n we have shown that the model is in agreement with the recent results from planck for natural values of the couplings .    \\n inflation  @xcite has become the standard paradigm for the early universe , because it solves some outstanding problems present in the standard hot big - bang cosmology , such as the flatness and horizon problems , the problem of unwanted relics , such as magnetic monopoles , and produces the cosmological fluctuations for the formation of the structure that we observe today . \\n the spectacular cmb data , first from the wmap satellite  @xcite and recently from planck  @xcite , have strengthen the inflationary idea , since the observations indicate an _ almost _ scale - free spectrum of gaussian adiabatic density fluctuations , just as predicted by simple models of inflation . however , inflation is not a theory yet , as we do nt know how to integrate it with ideas from particle physics .    \\n the brout - englert - higgs mechanism  @xcite in the framework of the standard model breaks electroweak symmetry , gives masses to the charged fermions and the massive gauge bosons , and predicts the existence of the higgs boson . \\n the recent lhc discovery of the higgs boson  @xcite completed the particle spectrum predicted by the standard model , and indicates for the first time that fundamental scalar particles exist in nature . \\n therefore , it is a natural thing to assume that inflation is driven by the higgs boson . \\n although the higgs potential is not suitable for a viable inflationary model , the presence of a higgs non - minimal coupling to gravity can change things to the better . \\n a large value of the non - minimal coupling @xmath2 is required , and given the uncertainties in the top quark mass and the strong coupling constant the model is still allowed  @xcite . \\n sadly , that large value of @xmath3 questions the validity of the scenario in the sm higgs inflation , as the inflationary scale exceeds the effective ultraviolet cut - off scale  @xcite .    as it was realized long ago \\n , radiative corrections can be the origin of electroweak symmetry breaking  @xcite . \\n the coleman - weinberg mechanism can not work in the standard model due to the large value of the top yukawa coupling , but it can work in models beyond the standard model  @xcite . \\n this is an interesting possibility given the higgs naturalness problem , in the following sense . \\n if heavy particles are coupled to the higgs boson , like in gut models , then the higgs receives large radiative corrections that bring its mass close to the gut mass scale . \\n supersymmetry at the tev scale can solve the problem , but given the severe experimental constraints on the masses of the superpartners , it was proposed recently the flatland scenario  @xcite , according to which electroweak symmetry is broken radiatively a la coleman - weinberg in the infrared region starting from a flat scalar potential in the ultraviolet region .    \\n regarding inflation , the coleman - weinberg type of potential is a simple and well motivated one , since it naturally arises when loop corrections are taken into account , and it is typical for the new inflation scenario  @xcite where inflation takes place near the maximum . \\n recently it has been studied in  @xcite in a b - l extension of the standard model , and a few years ago in  @xcite in a gut inflationary model . as shown in  @xcite in the context of the effective theory of inflation , cosmic microwave background together with large scale structure data \\n prefer double - well inflaton potentials . \\n the 2013 planck data confirmed this result , and not surprisingly the coleman - weinberg potential considered here belongs to this class , and succeeds to reproduce the @xmath4 value and the r bound from the 2013 planck release . \\n however , in  @xcite the inflaton was minimally coupled to gravity . setting @xmath5 , although it is a popular choice , is often unacceptable as was pointed out in  @xcite . \\n non - minimal couplings are generated by quantum corrections even if they are absent in the classical action  @xcite , and as a matter of fact the coupling is required if the scalar field theory is to be renormalizable in a classical gravitational background  @xcite . for early works on non - minimal \\n inflation see for example  @xcite and references therein .    \\n in the present brief report we imagine a scenario where inflation is driven by the scalar sector of some particle physics model beyond the standard model in which electroweak symmetry breaking takes place radiatively a la coleman and weinberg . since the scale of inflation is close to the gut scale \\n , we consider a gut model rather than a low energy one , and we also allow for a non - vanishing non - minimal coupling , as required by the quantum corrections already needed to give rise to the coleman - weinberg type of the inflaton potential . \\n we find that the model is viable as it is in agreement with the recent data from planck , and even more importantly for natural values of the parameters of the model .    \\n we start defining the model by the action @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the non - minimal coupling and @xmath8 with a coleman - weinberg type of potential of the standard form  @xcite @xmath9 where a is related to the inflaton quartic self - coupling  @xcite , and m is the inflaton vacuum expectation value ( vev ) at the minimum , @xmath10 . \\n the vacuum energy density at the origin is given by the constant term @xmath11 so that @xmath12 , and the shape of the potential can be seen in figure  1 , and the inflaton mass is given by @xmath13 . \\n at this point we stress the fact that the coleman - weinberg potential considered in the present work is the standard one obtained from one - loop corrections in minkowski spacetime . \\n the one - loop corrections in de sitter spacetime ( which approximates an inflationary background ) lead to a very different effective potential as shown in  @xcite .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     in summary , in this brief report we have considered a gut inflationary model where inflation is driven by the scalar sector of the model with a coleman - weinberg type of potential for the inflaton and a non - minimal coupling of the inflaton to gravity . \\n as is known , at tree level the @xmath14 potential can not trigger electroweak symmetry breaking , and in addition the corresponding chaotic inflationary model @xmath15 is ruled out by the wmap and planck data . \\n however , quantum loop corrections modify the inflaton potential and at the same time generate the non - minimal coupling term . the model is characterized by two dimensionless parameters , namely the non - minimal coupling @xmath7 and the inflaton quartic self - coupling @xmath16 . \\n we have shown that the model leads to predictions in agreement with the 95 per cent cl contours in the r-@xmath4 plane for natural values of the parameters of the model , both for @xmath7 and @xmath16 of the order of @xmath17 . ',\n       b' we introduce a new simple design of hollow - core microstructured fiber targeted to guide mid - infrared light at a wavelength 2.94 @xmath0 m . \\n the fiber has a triangular - core supported via silica - glass webs enclosed by a large hollow capillary tube . \\n the fiber specific dimensions are determined based on the guiding technique , which is based on the anti - resonant mechanism . for a triangular - core with side length @xmath1 @xmath0 m \\n , the fiber has a minimum transmission loss @xmath2 db / m and dispersion 2.3 ps / km / nm at the operational wavelength 2.94 @xmath0 m . ',\n       b' we introduce various notions of rank for a high order symmetric tensor , namely : rank , border rank , catalecticant rank , generalized rank , scheme length , border scheme length , extension rank and smoothable rank . \\n we analyze the stratification induced by these ranks . \\n the mutual relations between these stratifications , allow us to describe the hierarchy among all the ranks . \\n we show that strict inequalities are possible between rank , border rank , extension rank and catalecticant rank . \\n moreover we show that scheme length , generalized rank and extension rank coincide . ',\n       b' the classical picture of gut baryogenesis has been strongly modified by theoretical progress concerning two nonperturbative features of the standard model : the phase diagram of the electroweak theory , and baryon and lepton number changing sphaleron processes in the high - temperature symmetric phase of the standard model . \\n we briefly review three viable models , electroweak baryogenesis , the affleck - dine mechanism and leptogenesis and discuss the prospects to falsify them . \\n all models are closely tied to the nature of dark matter , especially in supersymmetric theories . in the near future results from lhc and gamma - ray astronomy \\n will shed new light on the origin of the matter - antimatter asymmetry of the universe .     \\n desy-07 - 186 + october 2007 +    address = deutsches elektronen - synchrotron desy , notkestrasse 85 , 22603 hamburg , germany ',\n       b' this article is a continuation of work on construction and calculation various of modifications of invariant based on the use euclidean metric values attributed to elements of manifold triangulation . \\n we again address the well investigated lens spaces as a standard tool for checking the nontriviality of topological invariants . ',\n       b' we study the effects of cu substitution in fe@xmath0te , the non - superconducting parent compound of the iron - based superconductor , fe@xmath1te@xmath2se@xmath3 , utilizing neutron scattering techniques . \\n it is found that the structural and magnetic transitions , which occur at @xmath4  k without cu , are monotonically depressed with increasing cu content . by 10%  cu for fe , \\n the structural transition is hardly detectable , and the system becomes a spin glass below 22  k , with a slightly incommensurate ordering wave vector of ( 0.5-@xmath5 ,  0 ,  0.5 ) with @xmath5 being the incommensurability of 0.02 , and correlation length of 12    along the @xmath6 axis and 9   along the @xmath7 axis . with 4%  cu , \\n both transition temperatures are at 41  k , though short - range incommensurate order at ( 0.42 ,  0 ,  0.5 ) is present at 60  k. with further cooling , the incommensurability decreases linearly with temperature down to 37  k , below which there is a first order transition to a long - range almost - commensurate antiferromagnetic structure . a spin anisotropy gap of 4.5  mev is also observed in this compound . \\n our results show that the weakly magnetic cu has large effects on the magnetic correlations ; it is suggested that this is caused by the frustration of the exchange interactions between the coupled fe spins .    ',\n       b' it was repeatedly underlined in literature that quantum mechanics can not be considered a closed theory if the born rule is postulated rather than derived from the first principles . in this work \\n the born rule is derived from the time - reversal symmetry of quantum equations of motion . \\n the derivation is based on a simple functional equation that takes into account properties of probability , as well as the linearity and time - reversal symmetry of quantum equations of motion . ',\n       b' a bayesian analysis of the world s @xmath0 data is presented . \\n we adopt a regge - plus - resonance framework featuring consistent interactions for nucleon resonances up to spin @xmath1 . \\n the power of the momentum dependence of the consistent interaction structure rises with the spin of the resonance . \\n this leads to unphysical structures in the energy dependence of the computed cross sections when the short - distance physics is cut off with standard hadronic form factors . \\n a plausible , spin - dependent modification of the hadronic form factor is proposed which suppresses the unphysical artifacts . \\n next , we evaluate all possible combinations of 11 candidate resonances . the best model is selected from the 2048 model variants by calculating the bayesian evidence values against the world s @xmath0 data . from the proposed selection of 11 resonances , we find that the following nucleon resonances have the highest probability of contributing to the reaction : @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 .    \\n the @xmath0 reaction : + consistent high - spin interactions and bayesian inference of its resonance content    t.  vrancx , l.  de  cruz , j.  ryckebusch , and p.  vancraeyveld    _ department of physics and astronomy , ghent university , proeftuinstraat 86 , b-9000 gent , belgium _ ',\n       b' we introduce a system of one - dimensional coalescing nonsimple random walks with long range jumps allowing crossing paths and exibiting dependence before coalescence . \\n we show that under diffusive scaling this system converges in distribution to the brownian web . ',\n       b' the microscopic formulas for the shear viscosity @xmath0 , the bulk viscosity @xmath1 , and the corresponding relaxation times @xmath2 and @xmath3 of causal dissipative relativistic fluid - dynamics are obtained at finite temperature and chemical potential by using the projection operator method . \\n the non - triviality of the finite chemical potential calculation is attributed to the arbitrariness of the operator definition for the bulk viscous pressure . \\n we show that , when the operator definition for the bulk viscous pressure @xmath4 is appropriately chosen , the leading - order result of the ratio , @xmath1 over @xmath3 , coincides with the same ratio obtained at vanishing chemical potential . \\n we further discuss the physical meaning of the time - convolutionless ( tcl ) approximation to the memory function , which is adopted to derive the main formulas . \\n we show that the tcl approximation violates the time reversal symmetry appropriately and leads results consistent with the quantum master equation obtained by van hove . \\n furthermore , this approximation can reproduce an exact relation for transport coefficients obtained by using the f - sum rule derived by kadanoff and martin . \\n our approach can reproduce also the result in baier et al.(2008 ) ref . \\n @xcite by taking into account the next - order correction to the tcl approximation , although this correction causes several problems . ',\n       b' we report the discovery of a @xmath0 quasi - periodic oscillation ( qpo ) in the x - ray emission from a bright ultra - luminous x - ray source ( ulx ) holmberg ix x-1 using a long _ xmm - newton _ observation . \\n the qpo has a centroid at @xmath1 , a coherence @xmath2 and an amplitude ( rms ) of @xmath3 in the @xmath4 band . \\n this is only the second detection of a qpo from an ulx , after m  82 x-1 , and provides strong evidence against beaming . \\n the power spectrum is well fitted by a power law with an index of @xmath5 . the total integrated power ( rms ) \\n is @xmath6 in the @xmath7 range . \\n the x - ray spectrum shows clear evidence for a soft x - ray excess component that is well described by a multicolor disk blackbody ( @xmath8 ) and a high energy curvature that can be modeled either by a cut - off power law ( @xmath9 ; @xmath10 ) or as a strongly comptonized continuum in an optically thick ( @xmath11 ) and cool ( @xmath12 ) plasma . \\n both the presence of the qpo and the shape of the x - ray spectrum strongly suggest that the ulx is not in the high / soft or thermally dominated state . \\n a truncated disk and inner optically thick corona may explain the observed x - ray spectrum and the presence of the qpo . ',\n       b\" the aim of this paper is to derive a new equation ( the _ acoustic - drift equation _ ( ade ) ) describing the generation of a flow by an acoustic wave . \\n we consider acoustic waves of perfect barotropic gas as the zero - order solution and derive the equation for the averaged flow of the first order . \\n the used small parameter of our asymptotic study is dimensionless inverse frequency , and the leading term for a velocity field is chosen to be a purely oscillating acoustic field . \\n the employed mathematical approach combines the two - timing method and the notion of a distinguished limit . \\n the properties of commutators are used to simplify calculations . \\n the derived averaged equation is similar to the original vorticity equation , where the reynolds stresses has been transformed to an additional advection with the drift velocity . \\n hence ade can be seen as a compressible version of the craik - leibovich equation . in particular \\n , ade shows that if the averaged vorticity is absent in the initial data , then it will always be equal to zero . \\n this property confirms that the acoustic streaming is of viscous nature . at the same time ade \\n can be useful for the description of secondary motions which take place for ` strong ' acoustic streaming flow . \",\n       b' we characterize the carrier density profile of the ground state of graphene in the presence of particle - particle interaction and random charged impurity for zero gate voltage . \\n we provide detailed analysis on the resulting spatially inhomogeneous electron gas taking into account the particle - particle interaction and the remote coulomb disorder on an equal footing within the thomas - fermi - dirac theory . \\n we present some general features of the carrier density probability measure of the graphene sheet . \\n we also show that , when viewed as a random surface , the resulting electron - hole puddles at zero chemical potential show peculiar self - similar statistical properties . \\n although the disorder potential is chosen to be gaussian , we show that the charge field is non - gaussian with unusual kondev relations which can be regarded as a new class of two - dimensional ( 2d ) random - field surfaces . ',\n       b' in this paper we give a complete description of the set @xmath0 of discrete faithful representations of the fundamental group of a compact , orientable , hyperbolizable 3-manifold with incompressible boundary , equipped with the strong topology , with the description given in term of the end invariants of the quotient manifolds . as part of this description , we introduce coordinates on @xmath0 that extend the usual ahlfors - bers coordinates . \\n we use these coordinates to show the local connectivity of @xmath0 and study the action of the modular group of @xmath1 on @xmath0 . ',\n       b\" we discuss a novel instability in inertia - less electron magneto - hydrodynamics ( emhd ) , which arises from a combination of electron velocity shear and electron density gradients . \\n the unstable modes have a lengthscale longer than the transverse density scale , and a growth - rate of the order of the inverse hall timescale . \\n we suggest that this density - shear instability  may be of importance in magnetic reconnection regions on scales smaller than the ion skin depth , and in neutron star crusts . \\n we demonstrate that the so - called hall drift instability , previously argued to be relevant in neutron star crusts , is a resistive tearing instability rather than an instability of the hall term itself . \\n we argue that the density - shear instability  is of greater significance in neutron stars than the tearing instability , because it generally has a faster growth - rate and is less sensitive to geometry and boundary conditions . \\n we prove that , for uniform electron density , emhd is `` at least as stable '' as regular , incompressible mhd , in the sense that any field configuration that is stable in mhd is also stable in emhd . \\n we present a connection between the density - shear instability  in emhd and the magneto - buoyancy instability in anelastic mhd . \",\n       b' dielectric nano - swithes made of the materials that exhibit piezoelectric and/or flexoelectric properties with significant electro - mechanical coupling are considered . in this case \\n , a nonuniform strain field may locally break inversion symmetry and induce polarization even in nonpiezoelectrics . at reducing dimensions to the nanoscale \\n , the flexoelectric effect demonstrates the nonlocality of the dielectric materials and plays more significant role than piezoelectric effect . the flexoelectric effect is included into consideration via additional term coupling strain gradient and polarization in the electric enthalpy density . \\n the equations of motion of the improved euler - bernoulli and timoshenko beam models , and 2-d plate theory have been obtained . ',\n       b' we describe methods for the fast production of highly coherent - spin - squeezed many - body states in bosonic josephson junctions ( bjjs ) . \\n we start from the known mapping of the two - site bose - hubbard ( bh ) hamiltonian to that of a single effective particle evolving according to a schrdinger - like equation in fock space . \\n since , for repulsive interactions , the effective potential in fock space is nearly parabolic , we extend recently derived protocols for shortcuts to adiabatic evolution in harmonic potentials to the many - body bh hamiltonian . \\n a comparison with current experiments shows that our methods allow for an important reduction in the preparation times of highly squeezed spin states . ',\n       b' we use x - ray monitoring data obtained over a broad range of time - scales to measure the broadband power spectral density functions ( psds ) of two seyfert galaxies , the broad line seyfert  1 ngc  3227 and the seyfert  2 ngc  5506 , which has recently been identified as an obscured narrow line seyfert  1 ( nls  1 ) . using a monte - carlo fitting technique \\n we demonstrate that both psds are reminiscent of the psd of black hole x - ray binaries ( bhxrbs ) in the high / soft state , and specifically rule out a low / hard state psd shape in ngc  3227 . \\n this result demonstrates that , at least where variability is concerned , broad line seyferts with hard x - ray spectra ( photon index @xmath0 ) are not simply the analogues of the low / hard state in bhxrbs , and the dichotomy of nls  1 and broad line seyferts can not be simply interpreted in terms of the two states . \\n we show that the psd normalisation in ngc  3227 is strongly energy dependent , with larger variability amplitudes at lower energies , unlike ngc  5506 which shows little energy - dependence of variability . \\n we demonstrate that this difference is caused by spectral pivoting of the continuum in ngc  3227 at high energies , which is probably also related to the large amplitude of variability seen in the 2 - 10  kev band in this agn . using the new psd data and new results in the literature , we replot the psd break time - scale versus mass plot for all agn with psd breaks measured so far , and demonstrate that higher accretion - rate agn appear to have relatively shorter break time - scales for their black hole mass than lower - accretion rate agn .    x - rays : galaxies  galaxies : active  galaxies : seyfert  galaxies : individual : ngc  3227  galaxies : individual : ngc  5506  methods : statistical ',\n       b' to obtain single crystals by solution growth , an exposed primary solidification surface in the appropriate , but often unknown , equilibrium alloy phase diagram is required . \\n furthermore , an appropriate crucible material is needed , necessary to hold the molten alloy during growth , without being attacked by it . \\n recently , we have used the comparison of realistic simulations with experimental differential thermal analysis ( dta ) curves to address both these problems . \\n we have found : 1 ) complex dta curves can be interpreted to determine an appropriate heat treatment and starting composition for solution growth , without having to determine the underlying phase diagrams in detail . \\n 2 ) dta can facilitate identification of appropriate crucible materials . \\n dta can thus be used to make the procedure to obtain single crystals of a desired phase by solution growth more efficient . \\n we will use some of the systems for which we have recently obtained single - crystalline samples using the combination of dta and solution growth as examples . \\n these systems are tbal , pr@xmath0ni@xmath1si@xmath2 , and ymn@xmath3al@xmath4 .    \\n a1 . thermal analysis , \\n solidification , a2 . \\n growth from high -

magnitude diagrams . \\n we also examined the physical and structural parameters of more than 1,000 pre - main sequence stars in ngc 2264 using the on - line sed fitting tool ( sed fitter ) of robitaille et al .    \\n we have compared the physical parameters of central stars from sed fitter and other methods . \\n the temperature of the central star is , in many cases , much higher than that expected from its spectral type . \\n the mass and age from sed fitter are not well matched with those from color - magnitude diagrams . \\n we have made some suggestions to improve the accuracy of temperature estimates in sed fitter .    in most cases \\n these parameters of individual stars from sed fitter in a star forming region ( sfr ) or in the whole cluster showed nearly no systematic variation with age or with any other relevant parameter . on the other hand \\n , the median properties of stars in ngc 2264 sfrs showed an evident evolutionary effect and were interrelated to each other . \\n such differences are caused by a larger age spread within an sfr than between them .    \\n the cumulative distribution of stellar ages showed a distinct difference among sfrs . \\n a kolmogorov - smirnov test gave a very low probability of them being from the same population . \\n the results indicate that star formation in ngc 2264 started at the surface region ( halo and field regions ) about 6  7 myr ago , propagated into the molecular cloud and finally triggered the recent star formation in the spokes cluster . \\n the kind of sequential star formation that started in the low - density surface region ( halo and field regions ) implies that star formation in ngc 2264 was triggered by an external source .    \\n the imf of ngc 2264 was determined in two different ways . \\n one method used the stellar mass from the sed fitting tool , the other used the stellar mass from color - magnitude diagrams . \\n the first imf showed a distinct peak at m @xmath0 2m@xmath1 , but the second did not . \\n we attribute the peak as an artifact of the sed fitting tool because there is no such imf with a peak at m @xmath0 2m@xmath1 . \\n the slope of the imf of ngc 2264 for massive stars ( @xmath2 ) is -1.7 @xmath3 0.1 , which is somewhat steeper than the so - called standard `` salpeter - kroupa '' imf . \\n we also present data for 79 young brown dwarf candidates . \",\n       b' we calculate a two - pion wave function for the @xmath0 @xmath1-wave two - pion system with a finite scattering momentum and estimate the interaction range between two pions , which allows us to examine the validity of a necessary condition for the finite size formula presented by rummukainen and gottlieb . \\n we work in the quenched approximation employing the plaquette gauge action for gluons and the improved wilson action for quarks at @xmath2 on @xmath3 lattice . \\n the quark masses are chosen to give @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 . \\n we find that the energy dependence of the interaction range is small and the necessary condition is satisfied for our range of the quark mass and the scattering momentum , @xmath7 . \\n we also find that the scattering phase shift can be obtained with a smaller statistical error from the two - pion wave function than from the two - pion time correlator . ',\n       b' in this paper our main result states that there exist exactly three combinatorially distinct centrally - symmetric @xmath0-vertex - triangulations of the product of two @xmath1-spheres with a cyclic symmetry . \\n we also compute the automorphism groups of the triangulations . \\n these instances suggest that there is a triangulation of @xmath2 with @xmath3 vertices  the minimum number of vertices required . \\n +        gunter lassmann@xmath4 and eric sparla@xmath5 +    @xmath4forschungs- und technologiezentrum der deutschen telekom ( tzd fe 124 ) , + goslarer ufer 35 , 10589 berlin , germany + lassmann@tzd.telekom.de + @xmath5mathematisches institut b4 , universitt stuttgart , + pfaffenwaldring 57 , 70569 stuttgart , germany + sparla@mathematik.uni-stuttgart.de ',\n       b' we report a study of the intensity and time dependence of scintillation produced by weak @xmath0-particle sources in superfluid helium in the presence of an electric field ( @xmath1  kv / cm ) in the temperature range of 0.2  k to 1.1  k at the saturated vapor pressure . \\n both the prompt and the delayed components of the scintillation exhibit a reduction in intensity with the application of an electric field . \\n the reduction in the intensity of the prompt component is well approximated by a linear dependence on the electric field strength with a reduction of 15% at 45  kv / cm . \\n when analyzed using the kramers theory of columnar recombination , this electric field dependence leads to the conclusion that roughly 40% of the scintillation results from species formed from atoms originally promoted to excited states and 60% from excimers created by ionization and subsequent recombination with the charges initially having a cylindrical gaussian distribution about the @xmath0 track of 60  nm radius . \\n the intensity of the delayed component of the scintillation has a stronger dependence on the electric field strength and on temperature . \\n the implications of these data on the mechanisms affecting scintillation in liquid helium are discussed . ',\n       b' we study possible topological features of kondo spin liquid phase in terms of the one- and two - dimensional kondo necklace models within the frame work of quantum o(n ) non - liner sigma model ( nlsm ) . in the one - dimensional case \\n , it is found that the bulk properties of the kodno spin liquid phase are similar to the well - known haldane phase at strong coupling fixed point . \\n the difference between them mainly comes from their boundaries due to the effect of the topological term . in the two - dimensional case \\n , the system can be mapped onto an o(4)-like nlsm with some o(3 ) anisotropy . \\n interestingly , we find that if hedgehog - like point defects are included together with the restoration of the full o(4 ) symmetry , our model is identical to a kind of su(2 ) symmetry - protected topological ( spt ) state . \\n additionally , if the system has the o(5 ) symmetry instead , the effective nlsm with wess - zumino - witten term is just a description of the surface modes of a three - dimensional spt state , though such o(5 ) nlsm could not be a proper description of kondo spin liquid phase due to its gaplessness . \\n we expect that the discussions might provide useful threads to identify certain microscopic bilayer antiferromagnet models ( and related materials ) , which can support the desirable spt states . ',\n       b' the concept of continuous - time random walks ( ctrw ) is a generalization of ordinary random walk models , and it is a powerful tool for investigating a broad spectrum of phenomena in natural , engineering , social and economic sciences . \\n recently , several theoretical approaches have been developed that allowed to analyze explicitly dynamics of ctrw at all times , which is critically important for understanding mechanisms of underlying phenomena . \\n however , theoretical analysis has been done mostly for systems with a simple geometry . here \\n we extend the original method based on generalized master equations to analyze all - time dynamics of ctrw models on complex networks . \\n specific calculations are performed for models on lattices with branches and for models on coupled parallel - chain lattices . \\n exact expressions for velocities and dispersions are obtained . \\n generalized fluctuations theorems for ctrw models on complex networks are discussed . ',\n       b' we present results of our search for collimated ionized winds in bipolar nebulae using the very large array ( vla ) and the australia telescope compact array ( atca ) . \\n our search is motivated by the discovery of an ionized jet in the bipolar nebula m 2 - 9 ( lim & kwok 2003 ) that may be responsible for sculpting the nebula s mirror - symmetric structure . to determine if such jets are a common feature of bipolar nebulae , we searched for optically - thick radio cores - a characteristic signature of ionized jets - in 11 northern nebulae with the vla at 1.3 cm and 0.7 cm , and in 5 southern nebulae with the atca at 6 cm and 3.6 cm . \\n two northern objects , 19w32 and m 1 - 91 , and two southern objects , he2 - 84 and and mz 3 , exhibit a compact radio core with a rising spectrum consistent with an ionized jet . \\n th 2-b exhibits a steeply falling spectrum characteristic of nonthermal radio emission . here \\n we present a preliminary analysis of these five radio cores and discuss the implications of our results .

level atom in a cascade configuration with both transitions coupled to a single structured reservoir of quantized field modes is treated using laplace transform methods applied to the coupled amplitude equations . \\n results are also obtained from master equations by two different approaches , that is , involving either pseudomodes or quasimodes . \\n two different types of reservoir are considered , namely a high - q cavity and a photonic band - gap system , in which the respective reservoir structure functions involve lorentzians . non - resonant transitions are included in the model . in all cases non - markovian behaviour for the atomic system can be found , such as oscillatory decay for the high - q cavity case and population trapping for the photonic band - gap case . in the master equation \\n approaches , the atomic system is augmented by a small number of pseudomodes or quasimodes , which in the quasimode approach themselves undergo markovian relaxation into a flat reservoir of continuum quasimodes . \\n results from these methods are found to be identical to those from the laplace transform method including two - photon excitation of the reservoir with both emitting sequences . \\n this shows that complicated non - markovian decays of an atomic system into structured em field reservoirs can be described by markovian models for the atomic system coupled to a small number of pseudomodes or quasimodes . ',\n       b' in this paper , we address which sources contributed most of the reionizing photons . \\n our argument assumes that the reionization ended around @xmath0 and that it was a relatively quick process , i.e. , that there was a non - negligible fraction of neutral hydrogen in the universe at somewhat earlier epochs . starting from our earlier estimate of the luminosity function ( lf ) of galaxies at @xmath0 \\n , we quantitatively show that the major sources of reionization are most likely galaxies with @xmath1 . \\n our approach allows us to put stronger constraints to the lf of galaxies at @xmath0 . to have the universe completely ionized at this redshift \\n , the faint - end slope of the lf should be steeper than @xmath2 , which is the value measured at lower redshifts ( @xmath3 ) , unless either the normalization ( @xmath4 ) of the lf or the clumping factor of the ionized hydrogen has been significantly underestimated . if @xmath4 is actually lower than what we assumed by a factor of two , a steep slope close to @xmath5 is required . \\n our lf predicts a total of 50  80 @xmath0 galaxies in the hst ultra deep field ( udf ) to a depth of @xmath6 mag , which can be used to constraint both @xmath4 and @xmath7 . \\n we conclude that the @xmath8 luminous galaxies existing at this redshift should reach as low as some critical luminosity in order to accumulate the entire reionizing photon budget . on the other hand , \\n the existence of significant amounts of neutral hydrogen at slightly earlier epochs , e.g. @xmath9 , requires that the @xmath8 luminous galaxies should not be fainter than another critical value ( i.e. , the lf should cut - off at this point ) . ',\n       b' the third us naval observatory ( usno ) ccd astrograph catalog , ucac3 was released at the iau general assembly on 2009 august 10 . \\n it is the first all - sky release in this series and contains just over 100 million objects , about 95 million of them with proper motions , covering about r = 8 to 16 magnitudes . \\n current epoch positions are obtained from the observations with the 20 cm aperture usno astrograph s  red lens \" , equipped with a 4k by 4k ccd . \\n proper motions are derived by combining these observations with over 140 ground- and space - based catalogs , including hipparcos / tycho and the ac2000.2 , as well as unpublished measures of over 5000 plates from other astrographs . for most of the faint stars in the southern hemisphere \\n the yale / san juan first epoch plates from the spm program ( ysj1 ) form the basis for proper motions . \\n these data are supplemented by all - sky schmidt plate survey astrometry and photometry obtained from the supercosmos project , as well as 2mass near - ir photometry . \\n major differences of ucac3 data as compared to ucac2 include a completely new raw data reduction with improved control over systematic errors in positions , significantly improved photometry , slightly deeper limiting magnitude , coverage of the north pole region , greater completeness by inclusion of double stars and weak detections . \\n this of course leads to a catalog which is not as  clean \" as ucac2 and problem areas are outlined for the user in this paper . \\n the positional accuracy of stars in ucac3 is about 15 to 100 mas per coordinate , depending on magnitude , while the errors in proper motions range from 1 to 10 mas / yr depending on magnitude and observing history , with a significant improvement over ucac2 achieved due to the re - reduced spm data and inclusion of more astrograph plate data unavailable at the time of ucac2 . ',\n       b' we show that a dynamical supersymmetry can appear in a purely fermionic system . \\n this  supersymmetry without bosons \" is constructed by application of a recently introduced boson - fermion dyson mapping from a fermion space to a space comprised of collective bosons and ideal fermions . in some algebraic fermion models of nuclear structure \\n , particular hamiltonians may lead to collective spectra of even and odd nuclei that can be unified using the dynamical supersymmetry concept with pauli correlations exactly taken into account . ',\n       b' we present the results of a survey for trans - neptunian objects ( tnos ) based on subaru archival images , originally collected by @xcite as part of a search for irregular satellites of uranus . \\n the survey region covers @xmath0 , centered on uranus and observed near opposition on two adjacent nights . \\n our survey reaches half its maximum detection efficiency at @xmath1=@xmath2 . \\n the objects detected correspond to 82  tnos , five  centaurs , and five  irregular satellites . \\n we model the cumulative number of tnos brighter than a given apparent magnitude with both a single and double power law . \\n the best fit single power law , with one object per square degree at magnitude @xmath3=@xmath4 and a slope of @xmath5=@xmath6 , is inconsistent with the results of similar searches with shallower limiting magnitudes . \\n the best fit double power law , with a bright - end slope @xmath7=@xmath8 , a faint - end slope @xmath9=@xmath10 , a differential number density at @xmath11 @xmath12=@xmath13 and a magnitude break in the slope at @xmath14=@xmath15 , is more likely than the single power law by a bayes factor of @xmath1626 . \\n this is the first survey with sufficient depth and areal coverage to identify the magnitude at which the break occurs without relying on the results of other surveys .    \\n we estimate barycentric distances for the 73 objects that have 24  hr arcs ; only two have heliocentric distances as large as @xmath16@xmath17 . \\n we combine the distribution of observed distances with the size distribution that corresponds to a double power law luminosity function to set a tight constraint on the existence of a distant tno population . \\n we can exclude such a population at 60@xmath18 , with 95% confidence , assuming it has the same size distribution and albedo as the observed tnos , if it exceeds 8% of mass of the observed tnos . ',\n       b' the unparticle stuff scenario related to the notrivial ir fixed point in 4d - conformal field theory is recently suggested by georgi . we illustrate its physical effects in deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) process . \\n a possible signal of unparticle related to parity violation asymmetry in dis is investigated . \\n it is found out that the behavior of this parity violation signal is sensitive to the value of the scale dimension @xmath0 of unpaticle .    \\n 0.5 cm    pacs numbers:14.80.-j , 12.90.+b , 12.38.-t , 13.60.hb '],\n      dtype=object)\n'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'decode'"
